# The Mall: Character Creation
Alternative character creation rules for The Mall, for use in place of [Liminal Horror’s Character Generation (LH pg 6-11)](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/).

The adventure/module for THE MALL can be found at [https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall)

## Step 1: Adding to the Mall
Each person at the table will propose one shop to be added to the mall (this is not necessarily their PC’s place of work). State its name, description and floor (1-3). Then, it’s time to make your characters!

## Step 2: Ability Scores & HP

a. Roll 3d6 for your ability scores (any two results may be swapped)

   * Strength (STR): Physicality, brawn & toughness.
   * Dexterity (DEX): Speed, sneaking & precision.
   * Control (CTRL): Willpower, charm & weird

b. Roll 1d6 for Hit Protection (HP)

## Step 3: Investigator Details:
Answer the following questions:
