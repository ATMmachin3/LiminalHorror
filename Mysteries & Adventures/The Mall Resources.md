## SYNOPSIS
The Mall is a wet, gooey, practical effects filled TTRPG adventure set in a 199x mall pulled out of time and space.
The mall’s denizens are trapped inside with a creature not bound by any one form. It slithers among them now, preparing to assimilate and imitate its victims until no one is left and it can open a rift between its home dimension…AND EARTH!

## CONTENT WARNING:
This module carries content warnings for death, human sacrifice, hallucinations, drugs, people trapped/imprisoned, instances of self-inflicted harm, temporal disorientation and body horror (bones and foreign objects breaking through skin, unwilling bodily transformation, bodily disfigurement).
