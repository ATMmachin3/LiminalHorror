## What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.

### Word Processors/File Organization
- [Google Drive][https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive] for file organization & management.
- [Google Docs][docs.google.com/] for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program (currently $54.99)
- Affinity has a bunch of helpful tutorials to lower the learning curve. I did find myself using a few of these [top 15 tutorials](https://designshack.net/articles/reviews/affinity-publisher-tutorials-reviews/) when I was starting out.
- [Tips for adding interactivity to your digital publications](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/tips-for-adding-interactivity-to-your-digital-publications/?fbclid=IwAR23JilQaxht5L6I3E86vihJwhO9kOTYo0Nd7fZrbv2w0y55zbqFcQm-Gjg)

### Image Editing
- [GIMP](www.gimp.org) is a free, open source image editor. While I do own Affinity Designer and Photo, I still primarily use this to edit the images I used in Liminal Horror.
