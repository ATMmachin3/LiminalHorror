## What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.
- [Free Graphic Design Resources & Best Practices For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/free-graphic-design-resources-and-best-practices-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This post gives a great overview of the different aspects of design (from programs you can use, to different ways of building your skils, to important things to consider when working with others' work).

### Word Processors/File Organization
- **Google Drive** for file organization & management.
- **Google Docs** for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program (currently $54.99)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a free website that really scaffolds small scale design in a way that allows anyone to create professional products. It is used a ton in teaching and other fields. A great overview by Jeeyon Shim, on how to use it in ttrpg spaces, can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20)
- [Top 15 Tutorials](https://designshack.net/articles/reviews/affinity-publisher-tutorials-reviews/). Affinity has a bunch of helpful tutorials to lower the learning curve and this had some good ones included.
- [Tips for adding interactivity to your digital publications](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/tips-for-adding-interactivity-to-your-digital-publications/?fbclid=IwAR23JilQaxht5L6I3E86vihJwhO9kOTYo0Nd7fZrbv2w0y55zbqFcQm-Gjg)

### Image Editing & Creation
- [GIMP](www.gimp.org) is a free, open source image editor. While I do own Affinity Designer and Photo, I still primarily use this to edit the images I used in Liminal Horror.
- [PIXLR X](https://pixlr.com/x/) Is a free browser based photo editor. Described as an easy-to-use photo editor (with help of templates)
- [PIXLR E](https://pixlr.com/e/) Is a free browser based, powerful photo editor. Described as an advanced editor for pros.
- [Dither Me This](https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/) is a tool you can use to dither images.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free vector graphic program.
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a free open source painting program.
- [Artflow AI](http://artflow.ai/) allows users to generate visual content wit hthe help of an AI. Currently it is built to generate portraits. The output is licensed under CC BY which allows commercial and noncommercial use with attribution.

Here is a list of alternatives to Adobe programs created by [xdaniel Art](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt) (they require a regular subscription that is predatory and if you don't pay you often get hit with massive hidden fees and lose access to things you have made/bought) <br>
