# The Annotated Archive of Game Design Resources
Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer (who writes their own system, or writes adventures for different systems). It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

## Where to start (a great overview)
- [Making An RPG Zine Start To Finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VSdmLw6bk&ab_channel=NateTreme) by the [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/) (Nate Treme). This is a fantastic overview of how to make a zine, especially since it guides the viewer through within the context of an actual ttrpg zine over its 4 and a half minutes runtime.
- [Digital Zinemaking Basics: A Guide by Zeshio](https://www.zeshio.com/blog/2021/8/28/digital-zinemaking-basics-a-guide-by-zeshio) is a fantastic overview to making a zine from start to fnish (through 8 detailed steps), guiding the reader through the process of developing Adventurer's Guide to the Yol'Najj Forest as the framing.

## HACKS AND SRDS

### So you want to make a game but are unsure about writing rules from scratch (also a note on writing modules/adventures/mysteries using existing systems)….
Well great news! Many games live their lives as hacks for other games/rule systems. This means that you can start with a framework from which you can adapt to serve your idea/concept.

**SRD (System Reference Documents)** is a way game designers share their work. Often it includes what can be used, and how, so that other designers can iterate and create new games.

Below are some examples of different SRDs that you can use as a starting point in designing your own game. Many games have an SRD, but the one’s I’ve included have robust communities around them and are versatile enough to meet a myriad of needs.

Games have different licenses that dictate what can be used from the core text. Be sure to check their use/licenses to make sure you meet the requirements in your final product (an inclusions of established statements, attributions, etc).

**Note:** Sometimes you don't want to write a hack or new game and instead want to write an adventure, mystery, or modul. Luckily all the advice in this guide still works for that. SRDs are still great because they can provide rules references that you can use to make your zine compatible. I wrote a small twitter thread on the different supports Liminal Horror provides for people who are wanting to write their own mysteries/sessions/adventures. That can be found here: [Interested in writign cosmic horror adventures?](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives/status/1430923992097984514?s=20)

### Example SRDs
- [**Liminal Horror**](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal-Horror-SRD/) by Goblin Archives: A rules lite modern cosmic horror hack of Cairn (which combines Into the Odd and Knave). It adds a stress & critcal stress fallout mechanic to those systems.
- [**Cairn**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/) by Yochai Gal. It is an adventure game where players explore dark and mysterious woods. It is based on Into the Odd and Knave.
- [**PINKHACK**](https://monkeys-paw-games.itch.io/pinkhack-srd) by Monkey's Paw Games. Rules for Fantastic Role-Playing Wargames, Monkey's Paw Games has created a combination of the Whitehack and into the Odd.
- [**Beak, Feather, & Bone**](https://possible-worlds-games.itch.io/bfb-srd) by Tyler Crumrine. This rule framework is one that involves building a world through collaborative map making.
- [**24XX**](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) by Jason Tocci is a framework of rules that works as a modular plug-and-play toolkit. Rules lite and dynamic, 24XX SRD is axtremely versitile and includes a plethora of templates and resources to help designers get started.
- [**Tunnel Goons**](https://tunnelgoons.com/srd) by Nate Treme. Tunnel Goons is an extremely straightforward system that fits on half of a page.
- [**Trophy**](https://trophyrpg.com/system/) by Jesse Ross. Trophy is a narrative system that focuses on the doom that befalls the characters. Beware the horror and doom that awaits.
- [**Wretched & Alone**](https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/wretched-alone-srd) by Matt Sanders & Chris Bissette. These are solo journaling games that focuse on struggle, survival, and striving to achieve.

## PROGRAMS

### What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.
- [Free Graphic Design Resources & Best Practices For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/free-graphic-design-resources-and-best-practices-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This post gives a great overview of the different aspects of design (from programs you can use, to different ways of building your skils, to important things to consider when working with others' work).

#### Word Processors/File Organization
- **Google Drive** for file organization & management.
- **Google Docs** for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program (currently $54.99)
- [Top 15 Tutorials](https://designshack.net/articles/reviews/affinity-publisher-tutorials-reviews/). Affinity has a bunch of helpful tutorials to lower the learning curve and this had some good ones included.

## LAYOUT and FONTS
Having a good font and layout is vital toward making your game engaging to read/use. Here are some resources I found to help learn about layout/design.

### Layout
- [Designing Layouts (Layout and the Grid)](https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout) by Clayton Notestine. This was the single most helpful resource in my learning how to do layout for my game. Not only does Clayton go over the core concepts of layout, but he goes on to give annotated examples of TTRPGs and their layout. 100/10 recomend.
- [Layout Design Tips For Your Next TTRPG Project](https://ghostlorestudios.com/layout-design-tips-for-your-next-ttrpg-project/) by Ghost Lore. This is the final entry in a series that gives a good progression of layout tips that is well worth reading prior to starting the layout of your project.
- [Why Is Layout Important in Graphic Design?](https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/why-is-layout-important-in-graphic-design) by Stephanie Corrigan is a great overview of layout prinicples with visual examples to reinforce concepts.
- [Pamplet RPG Template For Affinity Publisher](https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/wtf-pamphlet-rpg-template-affinity-publisher) by wizardthieffighter (writer of the awe inspiring Ultra Violet Grasslands). This template will get you all set up for writnig your own pamphlet using Affinity Publisher (a great single payment layout software...Adobe makes you pay monthly)
- **Pinterest**: Look up layout, design, zines on pinterest to see examples of different design ideas you can use. This helps build visual references for the kind of things that are possible.
- [My pinterest board](https://pin.it/1OIQmGq).
- [TTRPG Zine Layouts](https://pin.it/42u4uaC) by Guilherme Gontijo.
- [Designs that could be TTRPGS](https://www.pinterest.com/gontijodesign/ttrpg-zines-could-look-like-this/?invite_code=9aa2c221ccca41069445ba3e84693972&sender=478578035310725364) by Guilherme Gontijo

### Typography & Fonts
- [Typography in Ten Minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html), by Matthew Buttericks is a great resource for building your schema and dipping your toes into that world.
- [Summary of key rules](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html) is another great introductory resource by Matthew Buttericks.
- [Free fonts](https://twitter.com/gontijodesign/status/1394624373823348737?s=27) compiled as a twitter thread by Guilherme Gontijo.
- [Coding with Character](https://realdougwilson.com/writing/coding-with-character) by Doug Wilson. This blog is about utilizing different fonts for coding and could easily be applicable when thinking about what typeface to use for your project (especially if monospaced type aligns to the aesthetic of your project). Be sure to check the licensing of any fonts you are interested in to make sure they are available for commercial use.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Display) is a collection of fonts released under open source licenses.

## IMAGES

## CREATING YOUR OWN
One option is to design your own images. There are a few different programs you can use ([some are listed here](#programs)) to make your own maps and images. There are some online tools that allow you to create maps for your adventures. Always be sure to check the licensing information of resources you use.
- [Perplexing Ruins Hex Map Tile Set!](https://perplexingruins.itch.io/perplexing-ruins-hex-kit-tiles) by Perlexing Ruins is a fantastic tile set that is made available for use through donations. It provides assets for [Hex Kit Software](https://cone.itch.io/hex-kit)
- [Dungeon Scrawl](https://dungeonscrawl.com/docs/#/) by ProbableTrain is a map making software that supports you in creating [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## COMMISSIONING WORK
If you are like me and not the most visual creative oriented, luckily there is a robust group of talented designers and artists out there. Often you will see them advertising that their commissions are open. Have a clear concept in mind as well as your budget range. Understand that commissioning work is a collaborative process between professionals and requires respect and clear communication.

## PUBLIC DOMAIN IMAGES
For those of us who are not artists, or don't have a budget to commission art for our work, public domain images are what we use to add artwork to our games. These are images that are able to be used in commercial work (either because their copyright has lapsed, they are not copyrightable, or they were released under an open license from the start). Here are some places you can find art for your games.

- [Public Domain Art List by Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/public-domain-art) is an extensive list of public domain images and the different places you find public domain art.
- [A flickr collection of curated Public Domain Images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192445357@N05/galleries) by Guilherme Gontijo.
- [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a collection of freely usable photos.
- [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) is a collection of freely usable images. While it includes photos like unsplash, it is better known for its vectors and illustrations.

## ACCESSIBILITY AND DESIGN INTENTION
One of the big things I wanted when writing Liminal Horror was to push mystelf to find ways to support people's ability to access information. This largely arose from my background in teaching, and how it is important to provide multiple access points and opportunities for people to engage in the work.
- [Tips for adding interactivity to your digital publications](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/tips-for-adding-interactivity-to-your-digital-publications/?fbclid=IwAR23JilQaxht5L6I3E86vihJwhO9kOTYo0Nd7fZrbv2w0y55zbqFcQm-Gjg)
- [Making Your Game Accessible Is Easy by Nate Lee](https://sessionprep.wordpress.com/2021/07/22/making-your-game-accessible-is-easy-i-promise-2/?fbclid=IwAR2sB_U2uZuWPGtgRyH37Ktj-5YHaQWQt1GJSOlhlRXDoLK4pm1cnwd37mE)

### ePub
There are a lot of benefits to creating epub versions of games. Text only games are able to be used with screen readers, and have boosted accessibility functions (fonts, font sizes, margins). Two recent (as of August 2021) twitter threads have gone over how to create ePub documents. There will be a Liminal Horror Epub available for free in the near future (or past depending on when this is read).
- [Sean Patrick Cain](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1427356978872033285) had the initial twitter thread that went over step by step how he created a ePub version of his game Long Haul 1983.
- [Peter Eijk](https://twitter.com/JimmyShelter/status/1428439348417073159) created a followup thread to talk about how one can create accessible tables in ePubs using html.

## PRINTING and PUBLISHING

### Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).

### Printing & Publishing
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.
- [So You Want to Make a Zine: Printing](https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) by Mazirian's Garden expands on the different ways you can print a zine (use a copy machine, print at home, print at a print shop, print through an online printer).
- [Indie Game Publishing Resources](https://lonearchivist.com/indie-game-publishing-resources) by Lone Archivist collects many different avenues you could use for getting your game into print.
- [The Printing Process Demystified For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/the-printing-process-demystified-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This helpful guide goes over the different aspects of printing.

### Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.

## MARKETING
Here are two great resources on marketing your game, especially when starting out.
- [A Crash Course On Marketing Your Indie RPG](https://www.failuretolerated.com/a-crash-course-on-marketing-your-indie-rpg) by Sean McCoy (the cofoudner of Tuesday Knight Game and designer of the phenomenal Mothership RPG).
- [Marketing Yourself: Learn From Me As I Run Myself Like a Content Marketing Gig](https://peachpantspress.com/marketing-yourself-learn-from-me-as-i-run-myself-like-a-content-marketing-gig/)by Ash Kreider (designer and writer of The Watch).

## FUNDING
I want to preface this section by saying that I do not have a depth of knowledge in this area. Liminal Horror was self funded (mostly through me doing the different roles of writing and design) with a commissioned cover. Since this was a smaller work that leveraged programs I already had and public domain artwork, there was not a lot of cost involved. This is not the case for all games. I truly believe that work should be fairly compensated, and so looking into the future there may be times where funds will need to be raised to pay for:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are two main crowdfunding platforms: kickstarter and itchfunding.

### Kickstarter
[Uncanny Spheres Reflection's on Kickstarter](http://uncannyspheres.blogspot.com/search/label/RPG%20Publishing). There have been a lot of people who write about their experiences running a kickstarter. For a truly in depth wakthrough of the pitfalls, struggles, and successes of kickstarter and ttrpg publishing, then look no further than Ian Yusem's writing.

### itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is most likely the avenue I would go if looking to raise funds for future work. It allows creators to move away from Kickstarter and raise funds on the same platform many of us are launching games.
- [Itchfund FAQ](https://itchfunding.games/#faq) by KeganExe is a great place to get an overview of what itchfunding is and what it can do.
PlusOneEXP hosted a great discussion on Itchfunding.
- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clNyEWtF1Yo&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Jeff Stormer
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FJiCCoe5c&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with KeganExe, Adam Bell, Nic Masyk
- [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpsOqZ4sAWU&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Thomas Manuel & Sam Leigh.
- [Google Doc compiling notes on the discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MW7uZ2LS2BHGA2bZlZ9LwgCSzVZAVhzeHF4crxtUeQU/edit#heading=h.s68hu2kptye4) by EldritchMouse.
