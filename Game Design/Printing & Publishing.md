## Overview
- [A Year in RPG Self Publishing: Year 1](http://uncannyspheres.blogspot.com/2021/02/a-year-in-rpg-self-publishing-year-1.html) by Ian Yusem. This is a great peak behind the curtain on some of the realities of self publishing. Ian does a great job of consistantly opening their practice (and a few of their blog posts about Kickstarters are linked in the funding page).

## Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).

## Printing & Publishing
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.
- [So You Want to Make a Zine: Printing](https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) by Mazirian's Garden expands on the different ways you can print a zine (use a copy machine, print at home, print at a print shop, print through an online printer).
- [Indie Game Publishing Resources](https://lonearchivist.com/indie-game-publishing-resources) by Lone Archivist collects many different avenues you could use for getting your game into print.
- [The Printing Process Demystified For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/the-printing-process-demystified-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This helpful guide goes over the different aspects of printing.

## Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.
