Having a good font and layout is vital toward making your game engaging to read/use. Here are some resources I found to help learn about layout/design.

## Layout
- [Designing Layouts (Layout and the Grid)](https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout) by Clayton Notestine. This was the single most helpful resource in my learning how to do layout for my game. Not only does Clayton go over the core concepts of layout, but he goes on to give annotated examples of TTRPGs and their layout. 100/10 recomend.
- Look up layout, design, zines on pinterest to see examples of different design ideas you can use. This helps build visual references for the kind of things that are possible. Here is [my pinterest board](https://pin.it/1OIQmGq). Guilherme Gontijo is a designer who regularly shares his resources with others. His [website](https://www.gontijolab.com/) and [twitter (@gontijodesign)](https://twitter.com/gontijodesign) are a wealth of inspiration and deserve an immediate follow (you will see many more links to resources he has kindly shared with the community). This is a collection of [TTRPG Zine Layouts](https://pin.it/42u4uaC) and this is a collection of [designs that could be TTRPGS](https://www.pinterest.com/gontijodesign/ttrpg-zines-could-look-like-this/?invite_code=9aa2c221ccca41069445ba3e84693972&sender=478578035310725364).

## Typography & Fonts
- Starting out it can seem extremely daunting to learn about typography, fonts, and design. This is a great resource for building your schema and dipping your toes into that world. You can start with Matthew Buttericks [Typography in Ten Minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html), followed by his [summary of key rules](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html)
- Here is another Gontijo resource, a twitter thread he posted of [great, free fonts] (https://twitter.com/gontijodesign/status/1394624373823348737?s=27).
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Display) is a collection of fonts released under open source licenses.
- [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) is another place to search for fonts and includes easy to find licensing information.
- [WhatTheFont!](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) is a tool for finding out what font is used in an image.
