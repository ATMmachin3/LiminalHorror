## FUNDING
While you can write and create each aspect of your zine yourself, some parts may require funds to complete (either to make a reality or to commission someone to make). Some things that may require investment are:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are are a few different ways to raise funds for your game. There is:
- setting up a co-op
- slowfunding
- settig up pre-orders
- "crowd funding" platforms (such as itchfunding or Gamefound).

### itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is the format I curretly am using to create [The Mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall).
- [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire). As with all the Jalopy Design entries, this one is extremely infomrative in providing a deep look at the benefits and drawbacks to itchfunding in the context of their project.
- [Itchfund FAQ](https://itchfunding.games/#faq) by KeganExe is a great place to get an overview of what itchfunding is and what it can do.
PlusOneEXP hosted a great discussion on Itchfunding.
