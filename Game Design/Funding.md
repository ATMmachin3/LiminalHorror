## Funding
I want to preface this section by saying that I do not have a depth of knowledge in this area. Liminal Horror was self funded (mostly through me doing the different roles of writing and design) with a commissioned cover. Since this was a smaller work that leveraged programs I already had and public domain artwork, there was not a lot of cost involved. This is not the case for all games. I truly believe that work should be fairly compensated, and so looking into the future there may be times where funds will need to be raised to pay for:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are two main crowdfunding platforms: kickstarter and itchfunding.

## Kickstarter
[Uncanny Spheres Reflection's on Kickstarter](http://uncannyspheres.blogspot.com/search/label/RPG%20Publishing). There have been a lot of people who write about their experiences running a kickstarter. For a truly in depth wakthrough of the pitfalls, struggles, and successes of kickstarter and ttrpg publishing, then look no further than Ian Yusem's writing.

## itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is most likely the avenue I would go if looking to raise funds for future work. It allows creators to move away from Kickstarter and raise funds on the same platform many of us are launching games.
- [Itchfund FAQ](https://itchfunding.games/#faq) by KeganExe is a great place to get an overview of what itchfunding is and what it can do.
