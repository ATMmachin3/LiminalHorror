## IMAGES

## CREATING YOUR OWN
One option is to design your own images. There are a few different programs you can use ([some are listed here](#programs)) to make your own maps and images. There are some online tools that allow you to create maps for your adventures. Always be sure to check the licensing information of resources you use.
- [Perplexing Ruins Hex Map Tile Set!](https://perplexingruins.itch.io/perplexing-ruins-hex-kit-tiles) by Perlexing Ruins is a fantastic tile set that is made available for use through donations. It leverages the [Hex Kit Software](https://cone.itch.io/hex-kit)
- [Dungeon Scrawl](https://dungeonscrawl.com/docs/#/) by ProbableTrain is a map making software that supports you in creating [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## COMMISSIONING WORK
If you are like me and not the most visual creative oriented, luckily there is a robust group of talented designers and artists out there. Often you will see them advertising that their commissions are open. Have a clear concept in mind as well as your budget range. Understand that commissioning work is a collaborative process between professionals and requires respect and clear communication.

## PUBLIC DOMAIN IMAGES
For those of us who are not artists, or don't have a budget to commission art for our work, public domain images are what we use to add artwork to our games. These are images that are able to be used in commercial work (either because their copyright has lapsed, they are not copyrightable, or they were released under an open license from the start). Here are some places you can find art for your games.
