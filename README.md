**Liminal Horror** tabletop role playing game with one Warden (the facilitator)  and at least two other players. Players act as investigators navigating a modern world full of terrible and unknowable things that hide in the spaces between, looking for a way in.

Liminal Horror is a classless, rules lite system the eschews xp for high lethality and narrative growth.  The major shift from its parent systems is the integration of a stress damage system that can result in stress fallout. Stress Fallout is how characters are changed by exposure to the Old Powers (both narratively and mechanically).

It was developed as a modern cosmic horror hack of Yochai Gal's [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) (itself a child of Chris McDowell's [Into the Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/) & Ben Milton's [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave). Liminal Horror written by Nick Erickson ([Goblin Archives](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives))

The game is available for free as a Digital PDF and PDF designed for print at home. They can be found at the [Goblin Archives Itch.io](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror)
