# Currently Itchfunding The Mall

Currently **ITCHFUNDING** the first official module called The Mall [https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall).

The Mall is a wet, gooey, practical effects filled TTRPG adventure of mall-horror. Set in a 199x mall that gets transported out of time and space. The denizens of the mall are trapped inside with a creature not bound by any one form. It slithers through the mall, assimilating and imitating its victims until no one is left and a rift can be fully opened.

Think John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) but set in a mall.

# Liminal Horror
**Liminal Horror**  is a rules-lite, fail forward tabletop role playing game with Facilitator and at least two other players. Players act as investigators navigating a modern world full of terrible and unknowable things that hide in the spaces between, looking for a way in.

It was developed as a modern cosmic horror hack of Yochai Gal's [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) (itself a child of Chris McDowall's [Into the Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/) & Ben Milton's [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)). Liminal Horror written by Nick Erickson ([Goblin Archives](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives))

For fans of cosmic horror, Junji Ito, and TTRPGs such as: Call of Cthulu, Monster of the Week, Silent Legions.

## The Annotated Archive of Game Design Resources
This site also currently houses a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer (who writes their own system, or writes adventures for different systems). It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community. It can be found at the Game Design tab, or [here](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Game%20Design/)

## Create your own mysteries
I wanted to provide the tools for Facilitators to be able to easily create, run and share/sell their work. To do this I have created the Mystery Template in multiple formats. This template will help in planning sessions and in making the jump into publishing.
