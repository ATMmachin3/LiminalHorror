# The Mall

The first official module called The Mall is currently in development.

- [https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall)
- The Mall is a wet, gooey, practical effects filled TTRPG adventure of mall-horror. Set in a 199x mall that gets transported out of time and space. The denizens of the mall are trapped inside with a creature not bound by any one form. It slithers through the mall, assimilating and imitating its victims until no one is left and a rift can be fully opened.

# Liminal Horror

**Liminal Horror**  is a rules-lite, fail forward tabletop role playing game with Facilitator and at least two other players. Players act as investigators navigating a modern world full of terrible and unknowable things that hide in the spaces between, looking for a way in.

It was developed as a modern cosmic horror hack of Yochai Gal's [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) (itself a child of Chris McDowall's [Into the Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/) & Ben Milton's [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)).
