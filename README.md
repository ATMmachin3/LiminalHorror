**Liminal Horror**  is a rules-lite, fail forward tabletop role playing game with Facilitator and at least two other players. Players act as investigators navigating a modern world full of terrible and unknowable things that hide in the spaces between, looking for a way in.

It was developed as a modern cosmic horror hack of Yochai Gal's [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) (itself a child of Chris McDowall's [Into the Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/) & Ben Milton's [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave)). Liminal Horror written by Nick Erickson ([Goblin Archives](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives))

For fans of cosmic horror, Junji Ito, and TTRPGs such as: Call of Cthulu, Monster of the Week, Silent Legions.
