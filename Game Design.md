# Designing Your Own Game
Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer. It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource (maybe even in a different form) so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

Note: Down the line my hope is to start a community based resource that focuses on pushing PDF design and different forms of accessibility/information access in regards to TTRPGs.
