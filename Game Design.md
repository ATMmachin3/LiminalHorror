# The Annotated Archive of Game Design Resources
Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer (who writes their own system, or writes adventures for different systems). It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

## Where to start (a great overview)
- [Making An RPG Zine Start To Finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VSdmLw6bk&ab_channel=NateTreme) by the [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/) (Nate Treme). This is a fantastic overview of how to make a zine, especially since it guides the viewer through within the context of an actual ttrpg zine over its 4 and a half minutes runtime.
- [Digital Zinemaking Basics: A Guide by Zeshio](https://www.zeshio.com/blog/2021/8/28/digital-zinemaking-basics-a-guide-by-zeshio) is a fantastic overview to making a zine from start to fnish (through 8 detailed steps), guiding the reader through the process of developing Adventurer's Guide to the Yol'Najj Forest as the framing.
- **Markdown** is increasingly being a format that designers are using when writing. I find it really helpful in both the process and what it allows me to do (output in epub, html, and this website). Two great resources that are also included below are [Luke Gearing's "Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free"](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) and [Nate Treme's Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme). I think it is definitely worth looking into as a tool to use when designing.
- [5 Tips for Making Money in TTRPGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXeEbDBWbS0&ab_channel=JohnBattle) by John Battle is a great overview about how they got to where they are currently (both their games and channel are top tier).
