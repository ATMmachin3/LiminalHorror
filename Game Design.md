# Designing Your Own Game
Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer (who writes their own system, or writes adventures for different systems). It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource (maybe even in a different form) so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

[Making An RPG Zine Start To Finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VSdmLw6bk&ab_channel=NateTreme) by the incredible [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/) (Nate Treme). This is a great overview of how to make a zine, especially since it guides the viewer through within the context of an actual ttrpg zine over its 4 and a half minutes runtime (Initial Concept -> Write An Outline -> Draw The Maps -> Writing & Layout -> Illustration -> Editing -> Printing -> The Final Product).
