# Designing Your Own Game
I was inspired to make the jump into designing my first game after listening to [The Lost Bay podcast](https://thelostbayrpg.blogspot.com/). Ikoâ€™s fantastic curation of conversations with game designers planted a seed that grew very quickly. I ended up creating my hack of Cairn in two straight days of writing. Afterwards came the task of editing, refining, and learning a bunch of new skills (layout, graphic design, marketing, and so much more). I found that participating in a community of other designers was an invaluable help.

Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer. It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource (maybe even in a different form) so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

Note: Down the line my hope is to start a community based resource that focuses on pushing PDF design and different forms of accessibility/information access in regards to TTRPGs.
