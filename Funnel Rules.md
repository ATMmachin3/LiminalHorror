A **funnel** is often an intro game mode where each player has control of multiple PCs who are often fresh, inexperienced, and squishier then regular Liminal Horror characters. A common aspect of funnels is the spectacular and memorable ways PCs meet their grim ends.

------

### Critical Damage - Death (and dismemberment) in the Funnel

**Rule Change:** When Funnel PCs take **Critical Damage** (when damage hits their STR and they fail the resulting save) they die. This is different than the Core rules for Liminal Horror where they are incapacitated.

**Death**: When a character dies in a Liminal Horror Funnel it should be graphic, big, and memorable. Use the narrative, monster abilities/drives to inform what happens to the DOOMED PC.

**Some examples are**: loss of limb, split in two (or more) pieces, exploding, melting, combusting, eaten, ripped, sliced, mauled, crushed, de-fleshed, etc.

------

### Critical Stress - Becoming Weird in the Funnel

**Rule Change:** When Funnel PCs take Critical Stress and receive [Fallout](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/), the PC becomes lost, consumed by the weird abyssal changes of the fallout (they are now an NPC).

------

### Character Creation

Each player creates 3 characters according to the following steps:

- Generate the Ability Scores of each character by rolling **2d6** for each ability in order (for a total of 2-12 in each ability score). **No results are swapped**.
- Roll 1d4 to determine each character's starting Hit Protection (HP).
- Roll on **Background** table (below) unless the adventure has custom backgrounds.
- **Optional**: Roll on the **Traits** tables ([Traits](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Character%20Traits/) - Liminal Horror pg. 9).
- Each of the characters start with **a phone** (one slot), **cash** ($3d10 x 3d10 ) and **two items from their background** according to the following table:

### The Only PCs Left Alive

**After the funnel** any surviving characters become full fledged investigators.

-   For each ability, roll 1d6 and add the result to the ability score.

-   Roll 1d4 and add it to their HP

The surviving PCs may have higher than normal HP, but that serves as a small reward for surviving the funnel. Players can choose which surviving character (if more than one) they want to play as going forward. Anyone not chosen can be a connection for the PC ([Connections]([Getting To Know Your Character - Liminal Horror (goblinarchives.github.io)](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal Horror System/Character Creation/Getting To Know Your Character/)) - Liminal Horror pg. 8).
