# Facilitator Tools
DRAFT - These will be expanded and refined once digital layout of the pdf is completed.

The goal will be to create tools that people can use to help them in their facilitating of the game.

## Facilitator Tools
This following section seeks to provide different options for Facilitator when thinking about prep and play. Rely heavily on your principals and the overview at the beginning of the text. Some may want a little more guidance and so I have provided some initial ideas to get you started.

### Frameworks for play:
- Adapt pre-made mysteries from horror systems, modern or not.
- Use doom tracks/clocks for factions: Create drives, goals, and NPCs for major factions (different gov. Organizations, corporations, cults, etc). Have these factions work toward their goals. Provide sessions where players can directly come in contact with their plans and impact the trajectory. Clocks are a great way to track progression, setting steps toward the final goal. Steps should be revised as they come in contact and are changed by player choices.
- Choose a few “horrible truths” at play within the world, slowly creeping toward actuality. Look for ways that these truths manifest so the players can interact with them.
- Create your own mysteries and investigations to draw players in.
- Use dungeons and tombs from OSR modules as places for investigators to explore.
- Adventures can be whatever interests the table: mysteries, heists, intrigue, finding and containing incursions, confronting systems & organizations, investigating visions from beyond, or hunting cults and organizations.
- Look for maps, NPCs, monsters, or even just touchstone pictures that are evocative. File off the serial numbers and bring it to the table.

The goal is to have fun as a table while  telling  interesting stories of horror and mystery. Be sure to regularly check in, ask questions, and use things that excite players. Opportunities for critical thinking, clever decisions, and failing forward will lead to memorable sessions.

### Factions
A complex world of magic, paranatural, and non-euclidian pantheons are all potential factions vying for the unthinkable power of the Old Powers, regardless of the risk. Some are patrons, others adversaries, and almost all are warring with one another. This is a world thirsty for power. Some factions could be:
- Secretive government agencies with mysterious hierarchies. <- is “black budget” really a thing people say? Maybe just “secretive”?
- Private corporations experimenting with magics and acquiring objects of power.
- Modern fronts for ancient orders of widely varying world views and opinions on the esoteric.
- Old, powerful bloodlines forever changed by exposure to Old Powers.
- Covens of witches and warlocks wielding chaos magic, with varying levels of control.
- Ancient scholars whose souls should have long since left the mortal coil.
- Wise and terrible monsters  who have survived in the shadows and stood the test of time.
- The children and monstrosities that hide in the low and high places, long ago cast off by the Old Powers, coveting what they feel is entitled to them.
- Cults.  Cults of every shape, size, and ideology.

### Aspects of a mystery:
- **The anchors**: The victim, the event, the malefactor
- **Crime Framework**: Means, Motive, Opportunity, Next Moves
- **Threads binding them together (red string)**: Clues, traces, witnesses
- **Final piece**: connection to the paranatural.

### Themes
Cosmic Horror focuses around the fear of the unknown, dread, darkness, forbidden knowledge, futility, threats on a grand & existential scale. The scale of what you face is incomprehensible. Truth is unattainable. In a single word, you face: DOOM.

What is so versatile about cosmic horror is the ability to leverage other motifs in the larger horror genre (body horror, questionable humanity, evil locations, monsters/myths).

This game is designed to use any set of Old Powers, Old Gods, or Entities, whether borrowed or new. The game lives in the realm of the unknowable, so it is less about absolute truths and instead about grappling  with the vast and hostile entities as they enter into the world of the player.

### Setting
Liminal Horror was designed for a modern day setting. I recommend using a city you and your players know. This can root the weird within the context of the mundane. Use maps of local landmarks and buildings to breathe life into the city where your investigators roam.

Remember there are sewers, caves and subterranean haunts everywhere. Who's to say that an incursion hasn’t left a doorway to another land, just waiting to be stumbled through?
