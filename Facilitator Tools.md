# Facilitator Tools
This following section seeks to provide different options for Facilitator when thinking about prep and play. Rely heavily on your pinciples and the overview at the beginning of the text. Some may want a little more guidance and so I have provided some initial ideas to get you started.

## Creating your own mysteries (and sharing them)
[**Adventure Writing Primer: Liminal Horror as an Adaptable System for Modern Horror**](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Facilitator%20Tools/Adventure%20Writing%20Primer/) goes into depth on the different variables that can be adjusted in order to adapt your adventure to any horror subgenre you are aiming for.

[Mystery Framework Google Doc Template:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2KVL4owTgfal60nbN-mRa6s4G8cDm147gWiV95vNfw/edit#) I've made a draft google doc template for people to create their own mysteries. New designers (or Facilitators) can it use when writing mysteries and have layout done so one could easily export to pdf and sell their work on [itch.io](itch.io).
