Here is a collection of published mysteries and adventures. Some will be provided in full while others will link to their respective storefronts.

If you are interested in creating your own mysteries and adventures but don't know where to start, I have created a template that can help support you in your writing: [Mystery Framework Google Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2KVL4owTgfal60nbN-mRa6s4G8cDm147gWiV95vNfw/edit?usp=sharing)
