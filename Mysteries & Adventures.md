## Writing Your Own
- If you are interested in creating your own mysteries and adventures but don't know where to start, I have created a template that can help support you in your writing: [Mystery Framework Google Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2KVL4owTgfal60nbN-mRa6s4G8cDm147gWiV95vNfw/edit?usp=sharing).
- Liminal Horror is written in such a way to accommodate many different styles and structures. If you have type of sesson to play set to modern horror/weird, then Liminal Horror can work for you.
