# Liminal Horror Appendices
A collection modular rules, supplements, and additions that can be used with Liminal Horror. All are optional and all add different aspects to the core game. They can be mixed and matched to serve the tables' needs. As different rules are created for modules, they will be generalized and put here.

Maybe someday a 2nd Edition of Liminal Horror will collect all of the appendices together.
