# Digital Play Resource
In designing **Liminal Horror** my goal was to make is as accessible as possible.

The following nested links are the entirety of the SRD divided out in a way that is easy to navigate during play.

The SRD can also be found on the left navigation. It has the entirety of the game text in one place.

A **print copy** of Liminal Horror can be purchased from Exalted Funeral (coming soon)

A **digital pdf** can be found at <a href="https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror" target="_blank">https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror</a>.
