# The Mall: Character Creations
This is an alternative character creation process for making PC & NPCs for The Mall. This character generator is an optional replacement for [Liminal Horror’s Character Generation](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/) (LH pg 6-11).

While unreleased, this draft version is being used for playtesting prior to Itchfunding.

## Adding to THE MALL:
Each person proposes one shop to be in the mall (Shop Generator).  State its name, description and level (1-3).

## Character Creation Overview

### 1. **Ability Scores**

a. Roll 3d6 for your ability scores (any two results may be swapped)

   * Strength (STR): Physicality, brawn & toughness.
   * Dexterity (DEX): Speed, sneaking & precision.
   * Control (CTRL): Willpower, charm & weird

b. Roll 1d6 for Hit Protection (HP)

### 2. **Investigator Details:**

The investigator details section will take you through the bulk of developing your character.
   * [Why are you at the mall?](#why-are-you-at-the-mall)
   * [Where do you work (or where were you visiting)?](#where-do-you-work)
   * [How does your character feel about the mall?](#how-does-your-character-feel-about-the-mall)
   * [The Abyss Stares Back](#the-abyss-stares-back)
   * [Traits](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Character%20Traits/) (Liminal Horror pg. 9)
   * [Entanglements](#entanglements)

### 3. Starting Gear

   * All players start with a phone, some cash and notebook.
   * Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: hands and upper body (four slots), plus a backpack or bag (six slots). If all slots are full the PC’s HP becomes 0
   * Most items take up one slot – smaller items can be bundled together. Bulky items take two slots and are awkward or require two hands.
   * Characters choose 2 items they brought to the mall.
   * Mall Employees have a locker (they should mark what items they have stored in their locker).

### 4. Final Steps

   * Age: 1d12 + 17
   * Choose a clothing style/look
   * Name

## Investigator Details

After completing Step 1: Ability Scores & HP, answer the following questions. Links and references to the original character creation process have been included.

### Why Are You At The Mall?

This module was written to have the players be denizens of the mall.
The following three options are the main reasons your character would be at the mall **(RECOMMENDED)**

   * **You work at the mall**.  *Where do you work?  ([Shops Table](#shops-table)) What job do you do? ([Jobs At The Mall Table](#jobs-at-the-mall))*
   * **You are a customer.** *What is your reason for visiting today?*
   * **The mall is where you and your friends hang out.**  *What “scene” is your character a part of?*

**Optional Setup:** Included are five additional reasons characters may be at the mall. Multiple characters (or even the entire party) could choose the same option. Discuss as a table whether to include these options in character creation.

   * TV crew (Local Access or News)
   * Podcast/radio show (Investigating the disappearances)
   * Investigators (Looking into paranatural events in the area).
   * Inspectors (Sent from Health Department, HR, or from the corporate office)
   * Representatives from corporate (sent to judge the failing mall)

#### BONUS QUESTION: Church of the Empty Shell

*Do you have any feelings/thoughts/connection to the mall church?*

**General Background**

   * General spiritual teachings focused on progression of the self toward an unstated goal. No clear outward expression of a deity. Members wear matching gray tracksuits and white Nikes.

**Literature**:

   * “The act of overcoming.”
   * “It is possible to overcome your humanness”
   * “What lay behind us lies buried, because it is dead.”

### How does your character feel about the mall?
(or about life)? This is used in place of the core [Ideology and Beliefs](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Getting%20To%20Know%20Your%20Character/) (LH pg. 8) table. Players can also use that table as an additional step.

Some examples are:

   1. This mall sucks.
   2. Things are looking up.
   3. People are starting to notice the effort you are putting in.
   4. You cannot stop spending all of your money here.

   8. Is my shift over yet?
   9. This place is the root of your problems.
   10. 1You cannot escape this place.
   11. 1You keep coming back.
   12. Things can’t get worse.
   13. There is room for upward mobility here at the mall.
   14. If you work a little bit harder you can secure that promotion.

   16. The other people at the mall are the worst.
   17. When you’re here, your family.
   18. A job’s a job.
   19. Things are going to turn around soon.
   20. This place is your prison.

### The Abyss Stares Back

This section has been reduced to align with the assumption that most characters simply work or shop at the mall.
If you prefer you can use the expanded [The Abyss Stares Back table](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Getting%20To%20Know%20Your%20Character/) (LH pg. 8).

   * Is there something in your character's past that would make them more inclined to investigate the "weird?"

### Traits

[Traits Tables](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Character%20Traits/) (LH pg. 9) can be used to randomly generate: Physique, Face, Speech, Virtues, Flaws, and Misfortunes.

### Entanglements

## Custom Fallouts

These custom fallouts are written to align with the "weird" happenings within the mall. They can be used instead of, or in addition to the core [Fallout Table](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/) (LH pg. 22-23). The facilitator is also invited to write their own. Choose or Roll d12.

1. You hear the choir's song. It's melody is an ever-changing constant.
2. The spores have started to take root. If you bleed, small tendrils can be seen wriggling up from the surface.
3. Patches have started to form on your body. Light red, slowly overtaken by a deep green. Are they getting bigger?
4. Your insides feel like they are shifting, changing. Bones and joints moving in ways they couldn't before. The change seems to be concealed by your clothing...for now.
5. The thoughts/feelings become a thing you can sense, even when not in their proximity. The more you focus on others the more you're losing yourself.
6. You see a figure. Its form resembles a person. It regularly shifts and warps, sometimes in horrific ways. You think there's a pattern to the change
7. Piercing vision... with enough concentration you can see through the hallucinations. When you do this your eyes appear to others to be engulfed in flame.
8. Sounds begin to manifest as a visual sensation. At first, they are just shapes and colors, but slowly they start to become more distinct. Their form is unlike anything you've ever seen.
9. It has gotten in, beneath your skin is a mix of flesh and fungus. Your mind is still yours...for now.
10. The skin sloughs off an arm, leaving only bone held in place by tendrils. It is still fully functional and is stronger than when it was flesh and blood. STR saves are made at advantage (roll two dice and take the lower)
11. The tendrils have taken root, making you something else. Your new proximity connects you to the otherworldly. Add magic to your character sheet and generate three spells for your inventory. Casting a spell cause 1d3 stress to you.
12. Roll on the [Liminal Horror Fallout Table](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/) (LH pg. 22-23)
