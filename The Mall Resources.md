# THE MALL
The Mall is an official adventure module for Liminal Horror. Below are links to digital resources for The Mall.

## SYNOPSIS
The Mall is a wet, gooey, practical effects filled TTRPG adventure set in a 199x mall pulled out of time and space.
The mall’s denizens are trapped inside with a creature not bound by any one form. It slithers among them now, preparing to assimilate and imitate its victims until no one is left and it can open a rift between its home dimension…AND EARTH!
