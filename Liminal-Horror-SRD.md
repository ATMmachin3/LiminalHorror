# Liminal Horror System Reference Document (v.2.25)

## What is an SRD? How can is use it to create my own hack?
SRD (or System Reference Document) is often used in game design to mean a document that contains the information that is licensed for use by others to hack/create their own materials. Since Liminal Horror is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) all of the text is open for use (other systems leave the rules open for use but restrict specific lore/content). A project down the line may be an actual Hacking Guide that talks about the different components and how to use them. Until then, you can see how I adapted the core game text from [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/).

## Other formats for the SRD (files updated on 7/10/21):
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/GoblinArchives/LiminalHorror) - actively updated
- [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Px6ov7QiRNE3KBz1sgOO4CLOqV7eowX5_YIxNMa7ik/edit?usp=sharing)

## Overview

### Facilitator and Player
Facilitators make consistent rulings during play and facilitate situations in which the players can engage with the fiction. The goal is to create interesting stories of horror and struggle against powers greater than oneself.

### Player Choice
Facilitators provide players with as much information as possible in order to be innovative and clever in their problem solving. Risks should be clear, with multiple options for player choice present. Every choice matters.

### No Classes
Investigators are not limited by a predefined class. A character’s specialty begins with their background, equipment, and experiences.

### Growth
There is no leveling or mechanical experience in **Liminal Horror**. Success and failure lead to memorable stories. Building relationships, encountering void-touched relics, and stress fallout lead to character growth.

### Stress and Fallout
Play deals with themes of cosmic horror. This is represented mechanically with stress and Stress Fallout. Fallout centers on how characters are changed by the Old Powers. The design intentionally avoids using mental illness and trauma as gameplay mechanics.

### The Weird
**Liminal Horror** is designed to be set in a modern city. Characters slowly learn of the weird and dangerous things hidden in the dark. They will bend, or break, under the weight of the unknown.

### The Old Powers and their Progeny
The Old Powers are bound in the deep, far away spaces. Their progeny act as a connection to reality. Some scurry across its surface while others are trapped beneath it. Many serve knowingly while even more are oblivious to the plans they further.

### Death
The world is dangerous and death is always a possible consequence. It should be ever present but never random or unexpected.

Death comes for everyone, but some suffer a fate worse.

## Principles for Facilitators
### Information
- Information should never be kept behind rolls.
- Provide information readily and freely to facilitate critical thinking and clever play.
- Elicit questions from players and give them direct answers.
- The weird and their mysteries should be layered, leading players ever downward into the unknown.

### Secrets
- Leverage the themes of dread, forbidden knowledge, and fear of the unknown.
- Provide information on the physical and tangible reality to players but keep the true nature of things beyond reach.
- Slowly give investigators opportunities to pull at threads, drawing them deeper into the weird.
- The scale of what the PCs face is incomprehensible. True understanding is unattainable.



### Preparation
- Make the world alive, allow it to change and grow because of your players’ actions.
- Be flexible in your preparation. Create situations and possibilities. Plot and story should not be predefined.
- Give NPCs and factions motivations, flaws and drives. Have NPCs react accordingly to their principles, on and off screen. NPCs should always have a drive to survive.
- Play to find out what happens.


### Difficulty
- Realism and fictional positioning are a good starting place for setting difficulty.
- Choices should have consequences and all failure should be interesting.
- Saves cover various scenarios of uncertainty and risk. If there is neither, do not call for a roll.
- Reward cleverness and ingenuity.


### Danger
- The risk is great for lasting harm, fallout from stress and overwhelming danger of encountering the Old Powers or their progeny.
- Present the potential of danger clearly for players and give them the opportunity to react.
- Increasing the amount of stress will increase the rate investigators are enveloped by the corruption of the Old Powers.
- Characters die.


### Choice
- Offer tough choices.
- All situations should have multiple outcomes.
- Clarify player intent before dice are rolled to make sure players have all information that would be obvious to their character.
- The influence of the Old Powers bends and breaks reality, making the full scope of some outcomes obscured.
- Every action should leave an impact on the world in some way.



### Failure
- Failure should push the story forward.
- Foster a table where success and failure are equally exciting.
- It is encouraged to elicit complications or twists from players.



### Die of Fate
- Sometimes randomness is required. Roll 1d6 to consult the die of fate
- 6: Good result/ 4-5: Mixed result/ 1-3: Bad result

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- The numbers on your character sheet act as tools to mechanically engage with the game. They do not define your character.
- Use how your character has grown to inform your play.
- Embrace the weird and unknown.


### Teamwork
- Work to support others at the table.
- Elicit interaction from other players.
- Characters don’t always have to be aligned, but players should be aiming toward the same goal of memorable stories of horror and fun interactions with friends.


### Talking
- NPCs have drives and flaws. Interact with them as you would a real person.
- Build relationships, engage with rivals, and invest in the NPCs.
- Information and positive outcomes can often be achieved through dialogue. That being said, sometimes a cultist’s communion requires an offering of blood and bone.


### Caution
- Fighting is risky and the consequences of violence are long lasting.
- A shattered mind is just as debilitating as a broken body.
- Gain any advantage you can. Preparation can stave off certain doom.
- Magic is chaotic and wielding the unknowable can have dire consequences.
- Victory comes in many forms, and often it is a successful retreat.


### Planning
- Ask questions.
- There is no perception or intelligence attribute. How you engage with the world hinges on how you use the information provided.
- Reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding are necessary for survival.


### Ambition
- Discover the drives and goals for you as a player, your character, and the team. Use those to inform play.
- Try and fail forward. An engaging story is infinitely more interesting and memorable than simple successes.
- It is the complications and resulting actions that we remember afterward.
- Characters die, but the story will continue.
- Play to find out what happens.

## Character Creation

#### 1. Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have three ability scores:


- **Strength (STR)**: Physicality, brawn & toughness.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Speed, sneaking & precision.
- **Control (CTRL)**: Willpower, charm & weird


When creating a Player Character (PC), the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.


#### 2. Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting Hit Protection (HP). HP does not indicate a character's health but reflects their ability to avoid damage (both physical damage and stress). HP can be recovered after a few moments rest (see [Healing](#healing)). Both **Damage** and **Stress** subtract first from your HP. Some things do Damage, some things do Stress, and some do both.

**(+ _ Armor)** is  a tag that  items have to indicate that they provide protection from damage and reduce it before it is applied to HP.

**(+_Stability)** is a tag that  special items have to indicate that they provide protection from stress and reduce it before it is applied to HP.  Any excess damage or stress (past 0 HP) is applied to the appropriate attribute.

If stress would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table.

#### 3. Investigator Details
- Choose a name for your character,
- Roll a [background](#background). This informs their knowledge and potential skills.
- Choose a style of clothing or look for your character.
- Answer the [Getting To Know Your Character](#getting-to-know-your-character).
- Determine the rest of your character’s [traits](#character-traits-roll-d10-or-choose).
- Choose their age or roll 2d20+16.

#### 4. Starting Gear
All investigators start with an Investigator Bundle (a phone, cash, notebook & pen). Players then roll on the [Starting Gear](#starting-gear) tables to determine equipment. If indicated, add Magic to your character sheet and refer to the [Magic](#magic)

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack or bag (six slots), hands and upper body (four slots). Most items take up one slot, with smaller items that can be bundled together. Bulky items take two slots and are awkward or require two hands.

The [Equipment List](#equipment-list) has a more detailed overview of weapons and investigative gear. As a table, decide on what common household tools PCs have access to in addition to their starting gear.

#### 5. The Party
The final step is to establish a party set up using the [Party Questions](#party-questions) section. This provides the initial context for investigators and their journey into the unknown.

## Names & Background

### Names:
Choose a name that best fits the character you are wanting to play (often I do this at the end of the character generating process.

### Getting To Know Your Character


#### The Abyss Stares Back
What was your first encounter with the unknown? Roll or choose:

||||
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|1           |Lost a loved one under mysterious circumstances. |6          |The evidence online is too much to be ignored.     |
|2           |Witnessed something in the darkness. |7          |You survived an attack you cannot explain.     |
|3           |Something is lurking in your dreams. |8          |Someone close to you is pulling you in, or pushing you away.     |
|4           |Cult activity (perhaps they recruited someone significant). |9          |You may be a card carrying member in a secret society.     |
|5           |You read something not meant for mortal minds. |10          |You haven’t yet, that’s what session 1 is for!     |

#### Ideology and Beliefs
What is your character’s initial ideology/beliefs? What lens do they use to interpret the world and guide them toward action? Create your own or use the table below:

|   |                                                                                |    |                                                        |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------|

| 2 | You ascribe to a specific political ideology.                                  | 7  | A specific religion guides you.                        |
| 3 | Morality is black and white.                                                   | 8  | You believe in fate and it directly impacts your life. |
| 4 | Belief in higher powers. Astrology, spirituality, etc.                         | 9  | Free will is the only truth.                           |
| 5 | There are deep truths that others are not aware of. The answers are out there. | 10 | You believe in the power of community.                 |


#### Connections
- List one significant person to the investigator. What is their relationship? Give them a name and brief description.
- List one contact the investigator has. This could be connected to their background. What is the contact’s area of expertise and what is their relationship to the investigator?

## Party Questions

#### The Party
Why has the party come together? Use the answers from the Get To Know Your Character section to inform your decision. As a table create your own or use the table below (d6):

|   |                                                                                                                         |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | The investigators meet in a diner. They may or may not know each other. Fluorescent lights hum over checkered linoleum. |
| 2 | A simple “wrong place, wrong time.” The resulting event binds the investigators together.                               |
| 3 | United through self guided research. Online paranatural forum? Club? Support group?                                     |
| 4 | A mysterious patron that has brought the investigators together.                                                        |
| 5 | Members of the community respond to a series of mysterious events.                                                      |
| 6 | Investigators (either professional or amateur) that are looking into an event.                                          |

#### Character Bonds (optional)
Have each player state a relationship to another character at the table. This should be informed by the background, The Abyss Stares Back, and The Party section of character creation. Some examples are:

|   |                                                              |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | _____ is hiding something from me.                           |
| 2 | _____ is my ex.                                              |
| 3 | _____ saved me from whatever it was that tried to attack me. |
| 4 | _____ is my drinking buddy                                   |
| 5 | _____ is my co-worker at _____                               |
| 6 | _____ is my neighbor.                                        |


#### Vehicles
Determine as a group what types of vehicle or transportation the party has access to. The party may have access to more than one vehicle. Car chases are an essential part of solving a mystery.
Vehicles have HP. When it is reduced to 0HP it is totaled. Totaling a vehicle can cause damage to those in and around the vehicle.

## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in situations.


**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves in instances of physical power and endurance. Physical damage targets STR.


**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves in instances of speed, subtlety, and precision.


**Control (CTRL)**: Used for saves in instances of the weird, luck, social interaction, emotional strain, stress, and fallout. Stress targets CTRL.


### Saves
A **save** is the resolution mechanic used in play. Saves are only used when there is risk. If there is no risk or interesting narrative outcome, no roll is needed.

To make a save PCs roll a d20 against the target attribute. If they roll *equal to or under that ability score*, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

If there is a **contested action**, the party at most risk makes the save.


### Healing
Taking a quick rest for a few moments restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. Ability loss takes longer to recover from. It can take as much as a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

### Armor and Stability
A target's **Armor** value is deducted from incoming damage before it is applied to HP. Equipment can provide this bonus defence (e.g. +1 Armor).

A target's **Stability** value is deducted from incoming stress before it is applied to HP. Equipment can provide this bonus defence (e.g. +1 Stability).  These are often items, trinkets, or objects that provide a deep sense of comfort and connection to reality.

It is up to the Facilitator’s discretion to create additional equipment that have the tags (+1 Armor) or (+1 Stability).



### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. PCs may also take the deprived tag as the result of magical consequences or enemy abilities.

Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).

PCs can also gain Deprived or Fatigue from casting spells or through events in the fiction.

### Inventory
Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack (or similar case/bag) with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Facilitator's discretion. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Vehicles can be used to store additional inventory, but they are inaccessible if you are away from the vehicle.

*Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP*


### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Facilitator may have a player roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |


### Associates
PCs can hire **Associates** to aid in their investigations.

To create an associate roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the **Character Creation** tables to further flesh them out. Associates cost between 50-100 dollars per day. Some are prepared for violence, but may require a little persuasion in order to undertake something truly dangerous or weird.

Expert Associates: An expert is a more temporary associate who is employed for a very specific task. They have 3HP and have an area of expertise with corresponding equipment. They cost $300 per day.

### Vehicles
Vehicles have HP. When HP reaches 0 the vehicle is totaled. Totaling a vehicle causes damage to those in and around it.

Vehicle damage is relative to the target and its speed. Start at d6 and scale according to the fiction.

Damage against the vehicle depends on the method. Some instances may be Impaired based on the scale.

### Wealth & Treasure
Cash is the most common form of currency. Vendors (both legal and illicit) may require different forms of payment to access them. Different in game variables may alter the prices listed in the equipment section.

Debt transcends all boundaries and can be a boon or a burden.

**Relics** are powerful items touched by the Old Powers. They are dangerous and sought after.

## Combat

### Start of combat
At the **Start of Combat**, each PC must make a DEX save for a chance to act before their adversaries.
- **Success**: The PC may act before their opponent.
- **Failure**: The PC does not get to go during the Start of Combat round.
After the Start of Combat round, order proceeds with PCs acting, then adversaries.

### Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. If timing is necessary, use 10 second rounds to keep track. A **round** is comprised of character turns. During each turn all actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

### Actions
On their turn a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be *casting a spell*, *attacking*, making a *second move*, or some other *combat maneuver*.

Players state what actions they will take before rolling dice. If they attempt something risky, the Facilitator will call for a save from the appropriate party.

All actions, attacks, and movements take place roughly at the same time.

### Attacking & Damage
There are no rolls to hit. There are no misses, only varying levels of damage.

On their turn, the attacker rolls their weapon die, subtracts any Armor bonus, and deals the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess damage is then dealt to STR (see Critical Damage)

Some attacks deal Stress instead. These follow the same process of rolling the stress die, subtracting any relevant Stability bonus and then dealing the remaining total to HP. Excess Stress is dealt to CTRL (see [Critical Stress - Fallout Trigger](#stress-fallout-tables))

### Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers
An attack is **Impaired** if the attacker is in a position of weakness that would impact your effectiveness. Impaired attacks deal 1d4 damage. Some examples of a position of weakness are attacking through cover, being bound, mind clouded by shadows.

An attack is **Enhanced** if the attacker is in a position of advantage. Enhanced attacks deal 1d12 damage. Some examples of a position of advantage would be leveraging a daring maneuver, attacking a helpless adversary, or having your arm guided by the void.
Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

### Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Blast
The **blast** quality denotes an attack that hits everything in a target area with damage rolled separately for each affected. Blast can be anything from explosions to spectral tentacles to the impact of a space embryo. If scale is unclear, roll damage dice to determine the number of targets affected.

### Retreat
Escaping a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination in order to get away. Safely retreating is a victory in its own way.

### Critical Damage
If damage brings a target’s HP below zero, their STR is decreased by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid taking **critical damage**.
<br>Suffering critical damage disables the victim. All they can do is crawl and grasp for life. Aid and rest required to persevere or they will die in the hour.

### Critical Stress = Fallout
**Stress** that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's CTRL by the amount remaining. They must then make a CTRL save to avoid **Critical Stress**.
<br>If a character fails their CTRL save they take critical stress and gain fallout from the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table.

### 0 HP Stress = Fallout
If Stress to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they must immediately roll or choose a result from the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table just as if they failed their CTRL save.



### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their CTRL is reduced to 0, they are lost.

### Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an associate. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

### Morale
Morale is a mechanical trigger used to simulate a NPCs' desire to survive.

Enemies must pass a CTRL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's CTRL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP.

Some NPCs transcend measures of morale. Their proximity to the weird means their behavior diverges from other NPCs.

Morale does not affect PCs.

#  Magic

## Magic System
Characters may be able to use **magic** if they:
- Rolled it during character creation.
- Gained it through **Stress Fallout**.
- Were exposed and changed by the Old Powers during play. There are those who seek to mentor, and others who seek to inflict their lessons on others.

Random spells are generated using the table and process below.
- Each morning the PC must fill an empty inventory slot with a random spell. PCs can only ‘create’ one spell per day. Players may instead choose to prepare a copy of a spell they lost on the previous day.
- Spells use a single action.
- Afterward they leave the inventory.
- If deprived or in danger, the PC must make a CTRL save to avoid any ill-effects. Consequences of failure should correlate in level to 	the intended effect. Failure may result in Stress, Fatigue, injury, death or  Omens/Magical Catastrophe.
- Spell effects are decided by the Facilitator with input from the player. They should work together to come up with the general effect and scope of the spell. The Facilitator makes the final ruling in play. (Baseline: offensive spells typically cause d8 damage if it’s single target or d6 if it's blast damage).
- PCs can attempt to retain the spell by successfully making a CTRL save.
- **On success:** Spell stays prepared. PC 	marks fatigue in an inventory slot.
- **On a failure:** the player does not 	retain the spell, marks deprived and adds fatigued to their inventory.

### Spell Tables (adapted from Maze Rats)

#### Step 1 - Spell Formula (2d6)

|   |                             |                                 |
|---|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|   | 1-3                             | 4-6                                |
| 1 | Physical Effect + Physical Form | Ethereal Element+ Physical Form    |
| 2 | Physical Effect + Ethereal Form | Ethereal Element+ Ethereal Form    |
| 3 | Ethereal Effect + Physical Form | Physical Effect + Physical Element |
| 4 | Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Form | Physical Effect + Ethereal Element |
| 5 | Physical Element+ Physical Form | Ethereal Effect + Physical Element |
| 6 | Physical Element+ Ethereal Form | Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Element |


#### Step 2 - Spell Name (roll 2d6 for each table called for in the formula)

#### Scrolls
**Scrolls** are similar to Magic, however:
- They do not take up an inventory slot.
- They do not cause fatigue.
- They disappear after one use.
- Players must make a CTRL save or receive 1d4 Stress

#### Relics
**Relics** are powerful and dangerous items touched by the Old Powers. Relics often have limited use and a recharge condition. *Some examples:*

**Extractor** - 0 charges. An old brass cylinder that resembles a medieval syringe. Able to transfer a ‘consciousness’ into another vessel. *Recharge*: Use the Extractor to wrench the consciousness from an “disabled” vessel. Users must make a CTRL save or take 1d4 stress.

**Blade of Silence**, 1 charge. This ornate dagger can disable all magic within 50ft, as long as you pay its price freely. Give forth your own blood (d6 damage) to activate. *Recharge*: Sleep under a moonless sky.

**White Blade of Moonbone**: (best of 2d6 CTRL damage, 3 Charges) - This glowing blade is made for one task, to sever. *Recharge*: Under a full moon, sunder a memory from one's past.

**Stone of Behrit** 1 charge. Resembling a small egg with a distorted face. If you would take critical damage, ignore it instead. This stone activates and whisks you to safety. *Recharge*:
- Sacrifice an innocent soul to the stone, add deprived and fatigued to the character sheet.
- On the third recharge roll on [Omens and Magical Catastrophes](#Omens-and-Catastrophes) table.

**An Anatomical Guide to Memory**: The reader can converse with the souls bound within its pages. Take d6 Stress (CTRL) to read an entry. There are still empty pages in the book.

**Horned Ring**, 1 charge. Twist the ring to activate. You can sense how many people are around you and have distinct impressions of their inner feelings. Every hour your awareness becomes more refined, but take 1d6+1 Stress (CTRL). *Recharge*: Remove the ring, taking the Deprived tag for 12 hour

**Instrument of the Black Flame**: Some weapons have sigils and runes carved into them, warping and imbuing them with a heatless, black flame. The range depends on the weapon and they deal 1d6 CTRL damage to the target while dealing 1d4 Dex damage to the wielder.

<p></p>

## Stress & Fallout
Stress is identical to damage, but targets CTRL instead of STR. Stress may come as a result of narrative consequences, failed saves, magic repercussions, or enemy attacks. Stress targets HP before going to CTRL.

### Stress Examples
Note: The amount and frequency of how you deal stress establishes the tone and pacing of your game. It is a dial to control the amount of Weird your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 1 Stress  |  **GLIMPSE**: Encountering the strange or odd.  |
| 1d4 Stress  |  **CONTACT**: The weird and unexplainable.  |
| 1d6 Stress  | **EXPOSURE**: Directly encountering the unknowable. Reality bends.  |
| 1d8 Stress  |**CATASTROPHE**: Major Powers, Omens, Catastrophes. Reality is close to breaking.   |
| 1d10 Stress | **DOOM**: Direct contact with Old Powers. Reality rupturing. |

### Stress Fallout Tables
Some moments change an investigator forever.Some moments change an investigator forever. Players roll or choose from the the Stress Fallout table when either:
- Stress reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0
- The character takes **critical stress**.

Unless marked, the Fallout can only be chosen once per table. Each Fallout takes up an inventory slot. It cannot be removed.


**Note to Facilitators:** The tone of the stress fallout table reflects the themes and goals of the game. Adjust for what works for your table, adding or changing entries as needed to ratchet up (or dial back) the weird. This is the main mechanical dial for the cosmic horror of your game.

| 1                      | **Have you been replaced?** You’ve seen what they can do -their magics and their deceptions. What would stop them from taking you? Maybe you aren’t who you think you are? How would you even know? <br>During your next moment of quiet reflection, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 2                      | **Memories of an Unknown Traveler:** These memories are not your own. They are of a different time, a different place, from a perspective so unlike your own. The realities they walk through are so alien and different, their feelings so foriegn. If only you could understand what they experienced.<br>During your next rest, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 3                      | **Paranoia:** Is it paranoia if the worries are completely reasonable? You’ve seen what happens in the dark, you know what goes bump in the night. <br>After a week, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                                |
| 4                      | **Plagued by Nightmares:** It comes for you every night, without fail. You do not know if they are from the beginning, or the end. All you know is that they won’t stop, and that they must mean something. After a week of nightmares, tell your Facilitator two distinct images that linger at the edge of your remembering. |
| 5                      | **Mirror World:** Everything seemed okay at first, but now you are sure of it - the world inside the mirror is different. The side glances, the shifting of places, it is undeniable.<br>When you first start to notice, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                            |
| 6                      | **Odd:** You adopt an odd behavior that makes others uncomfortable. If you resist indulging in your “Oddity” for 24 hours, take the Deprived tag.

| 9                      | **Liminal Communion:** It wasn’t noticeable at first, but you’ve slowly begun to regularly do a sequence of gestures, words, or actions -almost as if you are performing a ritual.<br>When you first start to notice, make a CTRL save.

| 10                     | **Magical Corruption** *(this can be taken multiple times per character)*:  Flesh is weak. A part of your body becomes visibly changed through your proximity to the weird. The Facilitator and Player should decide on how that change manifests and if it has any mechanical impacts.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 11                     | **Threshold:** There is a pale door with a black handle. It is unremarkable other than the fact that this door can seemingly appear anywhere. Sometimes the door is in places it should not be. Sometimes it stands alone, attached to nothing at all. The one thing you are sure of is that it is the same door each time- one you have not yet been able to open. |
| 12                     | **Neural Superposition:**  You see images of unknown places superposed onto this one, sometimes making it difficult to tell what is real. In another time you may have been called an oracle. <br>When you roll **DEX saves**, roll 2d20 and take the lowest result. Once per day you see something significant (ask your Facilitator what it is).           |
| 13                     | **Seventh Son of a Seventh Son:** Enough exposure has shifted and changed you. You are more connected to the otherworldly. Add Magic to your character sheet and follow the rules. This new power is great, and terrible.<br>The first time you use a spell it causes 1d6 stress.<br><br>Your second spell causes 1d4 stress<br><br>Finally the third spell you cast causes 1 stress. |
| 14                     | **Marked by fear:**  The core of your being has been twisted and changed. When you act in a way that manifests your marked fear and have to make a save, roll 2d20 and take the lowest result. When you resist an opportunity to indulge the fear, take 1d4 stress. <br>Create a fundamental fear with your Facilitator.                                                                                            |

If you pass, increase your max CTRL by 1d6.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16                     | **Full to Bursting:** You have a feeling of fullness and contentment. <br>Next time you would fail a critical damage STR save:<br>you succeed instead. Immediately and violently begin to vomit vermin (player’s choice). <br><br>Any being that can see they must make a CTRL save or take 1d6 stress.<br><br>Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max CTRL, take the new result. |
| 17                     | **Progeny:** Something is growing inside of you. Hope has long since abandoned it, and it has no more room for dreams.<br>Roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18                     | **Fate’s Web** *(this can only be taken once per character but multiple times per table)*: At least a puppet can see the strings that bind it, if only you were so lucky. <br>Roll on the Magical Fallout Table - [Omens and Magical Catastrophes](#Omens-and-catastrophes).                                                                                                                |
| 19                     | **The Hunt:** Patronage is a dangerous thing. It becomes harder to ignore the primal impulses that burn deep inside you. Your attacks are **Enhanced** Critical Damage mutilates your body but you can continue to act. <br>You become the primary target of otherworldly and attacks made against you are **Enhanced**.                                                                |
| 20                     | **Doomed** *(this can be taken multiple times per character)*: <br>You have been branded for sacrifice, anointed for doom. If your next critical save against damage is a failure, you die horribly. If it is a success, you roll 3d6 + the number of times you’ve taken Doomed. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                        |

## Creating Monsters
Use the following template to model NPCs and monsters:
- Title (denotes the type of NPC/monster)
- NPC Name (most things have a name. Some have forgotten theirs and are now solely defined by their title)
-  X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X CTRL,
- Attack (dX, special items, qualities)
- Description (appearance or demeanor)
- Drive, behavior, tactic, or peculiarity
- Special effect or critical damage consequence.

#### General Principles
- Ability Scores are 10 unless noted.
- Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary.
- HP: 3 HP is average , 6 HP sturdy, 1 0+ HP is serious threat
- HP is Hit Protection, not a measure of Hit Points. It's a measure of skill, luck, drive, resilience.
- Flavor and style = memorable
- Use d6 as the baseline for damage.
- Including ways to deal stress makes the game more Weird (increases chance of Stress Fallout)
- Critical Damage triggers increase threat or strangeness

#### Creature Cheat Sheet:
- Able to avoid being hit? Give it **HP**.
- Soak up damage? Give it **Armor**.
- Physically powerful? Give it a high **STR** or larger damage dice.
- Quick? Give it high **DEX**.
- Weird? Give it high **CTRL** or ability to deal Stress Damage.

# Rules Summary

**ABILITIES**
<br>**STR:** Physicality, brawn & toughness.
<br>**DEX:** Speed, sneaking & precision.
<br>**CTRL:**  Willpower, charm & weird.

**SAVES**
<br>Roll d20 equal to or under target Ability. The party at most risk in a contested action  makes the save.

**HIT PROTECTION**
<br>**HP** reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage (both from damage and stress).

**HEALING**
<br>A quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

**DEPRIVATION**
<br>**Deprived** keeps a PC from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to a PCs inventory. **Fatigue** takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times

**INVENTORY**
<br>PCs have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.

**MAGIC**
<br> A new spell is created each morning. It is random or is a copy of one the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell. If deprived or in danger, a CTRL save may be required to avoid dire consequences.

**ACTIONS**
<br>On their turn, characters may move 40ft and take a single action. Actions are casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable action. These take place simultaneously.

**Retreating** from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.

For the **Start of Combat** round, characters must pass an DEX save in order to act.
Subsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.

**COMBAT**
<br>All attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their **Stress** or **Damage** die, subtract any protections from **Armor** (damage) or **Stability** (stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess damage is dealt to STR and excess stress is dealt to CTRL.

If there are **Multiple attackers**, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. **Impaired** attacks (position of weakness) reduce damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. **Enhanced** attacks (position of advantage) increase damage die to 1d12. **Blast** affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**
<br>Damage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death**; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 they are lost.

**STRESS & FALLOUT**
<br> Player chooses from the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table when either:
- Stress reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0
- A PC takes critical stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)

<br> Each Stress Fallout entry:
- Can only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).
- Consumes an inventory slot.
