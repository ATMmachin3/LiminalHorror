## Overview

### Warden and Player
Wardens make consistent rulings during play and facilitate situations in which the players can engage with the fiction. The goal is to create interesting stories of horror and struggle against powers greater than oneself.

### Player Choice
Wardens provide players with as much information as possible in order to be innovative and clever in their problem solving. Risks should be clear, with multiple options for player choice present. Every choice matters.

### Classless
Investigators are not limited by a predefined class. A character’s specialty begins with their background, equipment, and experiences.

### Growth
There is no leveling or mechanical experience in **Liminal Horror**. Success and failure lead to memorable stories. Building relationships, encountering void-touched relics, and stress fallout lead to character growth.

### Stress and Fallout
Play deals with themes of cosmic horror. This is represented mechanically with stress and Stress Fallout. Fallout centers on how characters are changed by the Old Powers. The design intentionally avoids using mental illness and trauma as gameplay mechanics.

### The Weird
**Liminal Horror** is designed to be set in a modern city. Characters slowly learn of the weird and dangerous things hidden in the dark. They will bend, or break, under the weight of the unknown.

### The Old Powers and their Progeny
The Old Powers are bound in the deep, far away spaces. Their progeny act as a connection to reality. Some scurry across its surface while others are trapped beneath it. Many serve knowingly while even more are oblivious to the plans they further.

### Death
The world is dangerous and death is always a possible consequence. It should be ever present but never random or unexpected.

Death comes for everyone, but some suffer a fate worse.

## Principles for Wardens
### Information
- Information should never be kept behind rolls.
- Provide information readily and freely to facilitate critical thinking and clever play.
- Elicit questions from players and give them direct answers.
- The weird and their mysteries should be layered, leading players ever downward into the unknown.


### Preparation
- Make the world alive, allow it to change and grow because of your players’ actions.
- Be flexible in your preparation. Create situations and possibilities. Plot and story should not be predefined.
- Give NPCs and factions motivations, flaws and drives. Have NPCs react accordingly to their principles, on and off screen. NPCs should always have a drive to survive.
- Play to find out what happens.


### Difficulty
- Realism and fictional positioning are a good starting place for setting difficulty.
- Choices should have consequences and all failure should be interesting.
- Saves cover various scenarios of uncertainty and risk. If there is neither, do not call for a roll.
- Reward cleverness and ingenuity.


### Danger
- The risk is great for lasting harm, fallout from stress and overwhelming danger of encountering the Old Powers or their progeny.
- Present the potential of danger clearly for players and give them the opportunity to react.
- Increasing the amount of stress will increase the rate investigators are enveloped by the corruption of the Old Powers.
- Characters die.


### Choice
- Offer tough choices.
- Seek to clarify a player's intent, establishing a clear choice between two outcomes. Sometimes both can be attempted for a price (risk, sacrifice, or a very clever idea).
- Every action should leave an impact on the world in some way.


### Failure
- Failure should always move the story forward. Often it is the most interesting outcome of all due to the introduction of novel complications.
- Foster a table where success and failure is exciting. It is encouraged to elicit complications or twists from players.


### Die of Fate
- Sometimes randomness is required. Roll 1d6 to consult the die of fate
- 6: Good result/ 4-5: Mixed result/ 1-3: Bad result

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- The numbers on your character sheet act as tools to mechanically engage with the game. They do not define your character.
- Use how your character has grown to inform your play.
- Embrace the weird and unknown.


### Teamwork
- Work to support others at the table.
- Elicit interaction from other players.
- Characters don’t always have to be aligned, but players should be aiming toward the same goal of memorable stories of horror and fun interactions with friends.


### Talking
- NPCs have drives and flaws. Interact with them as you would a real person.
- Build relationships, engage with rivals, and invest in the NPCs.
- Information and positive outcomes can often be achieved through dialogue. That being said, sometimes a cultist’s communion requires an offering of blood and bone.


### Caution
- Fighting is risky and the consequences of violence are long lasting.
- A shattered mind is just as debilitating as a broken body.
- Gain any advantage you can. Preparation can stave off certain doom.
- Magic is chaotic and wielding the unknowable can have dire consequences.
- Victory comes in many forms, and often it is a successful retreat.


### Planning
- Ask questions.
- There is no perception or intelligence attribute. How you engage with the world hinges on how you use the information provided.
- Reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding are necessary for survival.


### Ambition
- Discover the drives and goals for you as a player, your character, and the team. Use those to inform play.
- Try and fail forward. An engaging story is infinitely more interesting and memorable than simple successes.
- It is the complications and resulting actions that we remember afterward.
- Characters die, but the story will continue.
- Play to find out what happens.

## Character Creation

#### 1. Attributes
Player Characters (PCs) have three attributes:


- **Strength (STR)**: Physicality, brawn & toughness.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Speed, sneaking & precision.
- **Control (CTRL)**: Willpower, charm & weird


When creating a Player Character (PC), the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.


#### 2. Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting Hit Protection (HP). HP does not indicate a character's health but reflects their ability to avoid damage (both physical damage and stress). HP can be recovered after a few moments rest (see [Healing](#healing)).


**Armor** reduces incoming damage before it is applied to HP. Any excess damage (past 0 HP) is applied to the appropriate attribute.

If stress would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table.

#### 3. Name, Background & Traits
- Choose a name for your character,
- Roll a [background](#background). This informs their knowledge and potential skills.
- Answer the [Getting To Know Your Character](#getting-to-know-your-character).
- Determine the rest of your character’s [traits](#character-traits-d10).
- Choose their age or roll 2d20+16.

#### 4. Starting Gear
All investigators start with an Investigator Bundle (a phone, cash, notebook & pen). Players then roll on the [Starting Gear](#starting-gear) tables to determine equipment. If indicated, add chaos magic to your character sheet and refer to the [Chaos Magic](#chaos-magic)

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack or bag (six slots), hands and upper body (four slots). Most items take up one slot, with smaller items that can be bundled together. Bulky items take two slots and are awkward or require two hands.

The [Equipment List](#equipment-list) has a more detailed overview of weapons and investigative gear. As a table, decide on what common household tools PCs have access to in addition to their starting gear.

#### 5. Establishing the party
The final step is to establish a party set up using the [Party Questions](#party-questions) section. This provides the initial context for investigators and their journey into the unknown.

## Party Questions

#### The Party
Why has the party come together? Use the answers from the Get To Know Your Character section to inform your decision. Some examples are:
- The investigators meet in a diner. They may or may not know each other. Fluorescent lights hum over checkered linoleum.
- A simple “wrong place, wrong time.” The resulting event binds the investigators together.
- United through self guided research. Online paranatural forum? Club? Support group?
- A mysterious patron that has brought the investigators together.
- Members of the community respond to a series of mysterious events.
- Investigators (either professional or amateur) that are looking into an event.

#### Character Bonds (optional)
Have each player state a relationship to another character at the table. This should be informed by the background, The Abyss Stares Back, and The Party section of character creation.

#### Vehicles
Determine as a group what types of vehicle or transportation the party has access to. The party may have access to more than one vehicle. Car chases are an essential part of solving a mystery.
Vehicles have HP. When it is reduced to 0HP it is totaled. Totaling a vehicle can cause damage to those in and around the vehicle.

## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in situations.


**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves in instances of physical power and endurance. Physical damage targets STR.


**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves in instances of speed, subtlety, and precision.


**Control (CTRL)**: Used for saves in instances of the weird, luck, social interaction, emotional strain, stress, and fallout. Stress targets CTRL.


### Saves
A **save** is the resolution mechanic used in play. Saves are only used when there is risk. If there is no risk or interesting narrative outcome, no roll is needed.

To make a save PCs roll a d20 against the target attribute. If they roll *equal to or under that ability score*, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

If there is a **contested action**, the party at most risk makes the save.


### Healing
Taking a quick rest for a few moments restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. Ability loss takes longer to recover from. It can take as much as a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

### Armor
A target's **Armor** value is deducted from incoming damage. Equipment can provide this bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor).

Unless otherwise noted, Armor does not reduce incoming Stress (a value that targets a character's CTRL) and it would apply straight to a character’s Hit Protection. Some equipment may provide a bonus defense against Stress (e.g. + 1 Stress Armor).


### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. PCs may also take the deprived tag as the result of magical consequences or enemy abilities.

Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).

PCs can also gain Deprived or Fatigue from casting spells or through events in the fiction.

### Inventory
Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack (or similar case/bag) with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head).

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Vehicles can be used to store additional inventory, but they are inaccessible if you are away from the vehicle.


### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Associates
PCs can hire **Associates** to aid in their investigations.

To create an associate roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the **Character Creation** tables to further flesh them out. Associates cost between 50-100 dollars per day. Some are prepared for violence, but may require a little persuasion in order to undertake something truly dangerous or weird.

Expert Associates: An expert is a more temporary associate who is employed for a very specific task. They have 3HP and have an area of expertise with corresponding equipment. They cost $300 per day.

### Vehicles
Vehicles have HP. When HP reaches 0 the vehicle is totaled. Totaling a vehicle causes damage to those in and around it.

Vehicle damage is relative to the target and its speed. Start at d6 and scale according to the fiction.

Damage against the vehicle depends on the method. Some instances may be Impaired based on the scale.

### Wealth & Treasure
Cash is the most common form of currency. Vendors (both legal and illicit) may require different forms of payment to access them. Different in game variables may alter the prices listed in the equipment section.

Debt transcends all boundaries and can be a boon or a burden.

**Relics** are powerful items touched by the Old Powers. They are dangerous and sought after.

## Combat

### Start of combat
At the **Start of Combat**, each PC must make a DEX save for a chance to act before their adversaries.
- **Success**: The PC may act before their opponent.
- **Failure**: The PC does not get to go during the Start of Combat round.
After the Start of Combat round, order proceeds with PCs acting, then adversaries.

### Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. If timing is necessary, use 10 second rounds to keep track. A **round** is comprised of character turns. During each turn all actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

### Actions
On their turn a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be *casting a spell*, *attacking*, making a *second move*, or some other *combat maneuver*.

Players state what actions they will take before rolling dice. If they attempt something risky, the Warden will call for a save from the appropriate party.

All actions, attacks, and movements take place roughly at the same time.

### Attacking & Damage
There are no rolls to hit. There are no misses, only varying levels of damage.

On their turn, the attacker rolls their weapon die, subtracts any Armor bonus, and deals the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess damage is then dealt to STR (see Critical Damage)

Some attacks deal Stress instead. These follow the same process of rolling the stress die, subtracting any relevant Armor bonus and then dealing the remaining total to HP. Excess Stress is dealt to CTRL (see Critical Stress - Fallout Trigger)

### Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers
An attack is **Impaired** if the attacker is in a position of weakness that would impact your effectiveness. Impaired attacks deal 1d4 damage. Some examples of a position of weakness are attacking through cover, being bound, mind clouded by shadows.

An attack is **Enhanced** if the attacker is in a position of advantage. Enhanced attacks deal 1d12 damage. Some examples of a position of advantage would be leveraging a daring maneuver, attacking a helpless adversary, or having your arm guided by the void.
Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

### Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Blast
The **blast** quality denotes an attack that hits everything in a target area with damage rolled separately for each affected. Blast can be anything from explosions to spectral tentacles to the impact of a space embryo. If scale is unclear, roll damage dice to determine the number of targets affected.

### Retreat
Escaping a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination in order to get away. Safely retreating is a victory in its own way.

### Critical Damage
If damage brings a target’s HP below zero, their STR is decreased by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid taking **critical damage**. Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### 0 HP Stress - Fallout Trigger
When stress to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are changed irrevocably. The PC gains a fallout from the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table.

### Critical Stress - Fallout Trigger
Stress that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's CTRL by the amount remaining. They must then make a CTRL save to avoid critical stress .

When a character fails their CTRL save they take critical stress. They then select an appropriate effect on the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table.


### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their CTRL is reduced to 0, they are lost.

### Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an associate. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

### Morale
Morale is a mechanical trigger used to simulate a NPCs' desire to survive.

Enemies must pass a CTRL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's CTRL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP.

Some NPCs transcend measures of morale. Their proximity to the weird means their behavior diverges from other NPCs.

Morale does not affect PCs.

## Chaos Magic
### Magic System
Characters may be able to use chaotic **magic** if they:
- Rolled it during character creation.
- Gained it through Major Stress Fallout.
- Were exposed and changed by the Old Powers during play. There are those who seek to mentor, and others who seek to inflict their lessons on others.

Random spells are generated using the table and process below.
- Each morning the PC must fill an empty inventory slot with a random spell. PCs can only ‘create’ one spell per day. Players may instead choose to prepare a copy of a spell they lost on the previous day.
- Spells are cast using a single action. After casting they leave the inventory slot.
- If the PC is deprived or in danger, the PC must make a CTRL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure when using magic should correlate in level to the intended effect. Failure may result in Stress, Fatigue, Magical Fallout, injury, or even death.
- Spell effects are decided by the warden with input from the player. They should work together to come up with the general effect and scope of the spell. The warden makes the final ruling in play. (Baseline: offensive spells typically cause d8 damage if it’s single target or d6 if it's blast damage).
- PCs can attempt to retain the spell by successfully making a CTRL save.
**On success:** Spell stays prepared. PC marks fatigue in an inventory slot.
**On a failure:** the player rolls on the Magical Fallout Table.

### Spell Tables (adapted from Maze Rats)

#### Step 1 - Spell Formula (2d6)

|   |                             |                                 |

| 1 | Physical Effect + Physical Form | Ethereal Element+ Physical Form    |
| 2 | Physical Effect + Ethereal Form | Ethereal Element+ Ethereal Form    |
| 3 | Ethereal Effect + Physical Form | Physical Effect + Physical Element |
| 4 | Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Form | Physical Effect + Ethereal Element |
| 5 | Physical Element+ Physical Form | Ethereal Effect + Physical Element |
| 6 | Physical Element+ Ethereal Form | Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Element |

#### Scrolls
**Scrolls** are similar to Chaos Magic, however:
- They do not take up an inventory slot.
- They do not cause fatigue.
- They disappear after one use.
- Players must make a CTRL save or receive 1d4 Stress

#### Relics
**Relics** are powerful and dangerous items touched by the Old Powers. Relics often have limited use and a recharge condition. *Some examples:*

**Extractor** - 0 charges. An old brass cylinder that resembles a medieval syringe. Able to transfer a ‘consciousness’ into another vessel. *Recharge*: Use the Extractor to wrench the consciousness from an “disabled” vessel. Users must make a CTRL save or take 1d4 stress.

**Blade of Silence**, 1 charge. This ornate dagger can disable all magic within 50ft, as long as you pay its price freely. Give forth your own blood (d6 damage) to activate. *Recharge*: Sleep under a moonless sky.

**White Blade of Moonbone**: (best of 2d6 CTRL damage, 3 Charges) - This glowing blade is made for one task, to sever. *Recharge*: Under a full moon, sunder a memory from one's past.

**Stone of Behrit** 1 charge. Resembling a small egg with a distorted face. If you would take critical damage, ignore it instead. This stone activates and whisks you to safety. *Recharge*:
- Sacrifice an innocent soul to the stone and roll on Magical Fallout Table (Mutations).
- On the third recharge roll on Magical Fallout Table (Omens/Magical Catastrophes)

**An Anatomical Guide to Memory**: The reader can converse with the souls bound within its pages. Take d6 Stress (CTRL) to read an entry. There are still empty pages in the book.

**Horned Ring**, 1 charge. Twist the ring to activate. You can sense how many people are around you and have distinct impressions of their inner feelings. Every hour your awareness becomes more refined, but take 1d6+1 Stress (CTRL). *Recharge*: Remove the ring, taking the Deprived tag for 12 hour

**Instrument of the Black Flame**: Some weapons have sigils and runes carved into them, warping and imbuing them with a heatless, black flame. The range depends on the weapon and they deal 1d6 CTRL damage to the target while dealing 1d4 Dex damage to the wielder.

## Stress & Fallout
Stress is identical to damage, but targets CTRL instead of STR. Stress may come as a result of narrative consequences, failed saves, magic repercussions, or enemy attacks. Stress targets HP before going to CTRL.

#### Stress Examples
Note: The amount and frequency of how you deal stress establishes the tone and pacing of your game. It is a dial to control the amount of Weird your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 1 Stress  |  **GLIMPSE**: Encountering the strange or odd.  |
| 1d4 Stress  |  **CONTACT**: The weird and unexplainable.  |
| 1d6 Stress  | **EXPOSURE**: Directly encountering the unknowable. Reality bends.  |
| 1d8 Stress  |**CATASTROPHE**: Major Powers, Omens, Catastrophes. Reality is close to breaking.   |
| 1d10 Stress | **DOOM**: Direct contact with Old Powers. Reality rupturing. |

#### Stress Fallout Tables
Some moments change an investigator forever. Use the Stress fallout table when either:
- Stress reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0
- The character takes **critical stress**.


Choose an appropriate result that makes narrative sense from the table below. Unless marked, Stress Fallout can only be chosen once per table.


Each stress fallout takes up an inventory slot. It cannot be removed.


**Note to Wardens:** The tone of the stress fallout table reflects the themes and goals of the game. Adjust for what works for your table, adding or changing entries as needed to ratchet up (or dial back) the weird. This is the main mechanical dial for the cosmic horror of your game.

| 1                      | **Have you been replaced?** You’ve seen what they can do -their magics and their deceptions. What would stop them from taking you? Maybe you aren’t who you think you are? How would you even know? <br>During your next moment of quiet reflection, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 2                      | **Memories of an Unknown Traveler:** These memories are not your own. They are of a different time, a different place, from a perspective so unlike your own. The realities they walk through are so alien and different, their feelings so foriegn. If only you could understand what they experienced.<br>During your next rest, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 3                      | **Paranoia:** Is it paranoia if the worries are completely reasonable? You’ve seen what happens in the dark, you know what goes bump in the night. <br>After a week, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                                |
| 4                      | **Plagued by Nightmares:** It comes for you every night, without fail. You do not know if they are from the beginning, or the end. All you know is that they won’t stop, and that they must mean something. After a week of nightmares, tell your Warden three distinct images that linger at the edge of your remembering. |
| 5                      | **Mirror World:** Everything seemed okay at first, but now you are sure of it - the world inside the mirror is different. The side glances, the shifting of places, it is undeniable.<br>When you first start to notice, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                            |
| 6                      | **The Weird:** You adopt a strange behavior that makes others uncomfortable. If you resist indulging in your “Weird” for 24 hours, take the Deprived tag. If others see you engage in this unsettling behavior, they must make a CTRL save or take 1d4 Stress.<br>After the first instance, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current CTRL, take the new result. |
| 7                      | **Hunger:** You develop a strange appetite. What you hunger for is unusual, maybe even forbidden. If you do not indulge your hunger for 24 hours, take the Deprived tag. When you eat, restore HP and give 1d4 stress to any that can see.<br>After the first instance, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current STR, take the new result. |
| 8                      | **Scarred:** Every wound you inflict leaves its ragged mark upon your body.<br>After the first instance, make a CTRL save. If you pass, increase your max STR by 1d4.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9                      | **Liminal Communion:** It wasn’t noticeable at first, but you’ve slowly begun to regularly do a sequence of gestures, words, or actions -almost as if you are performing a ritual.<br>When you first start to notice, make a CTRL save. If you pass, increase your max CTRL by 1d4.                                         |

It becomes harder to ignore the primal impulses that burn deep inside you.<br>You become the primary target of otherworldly forces but your attacks now use 1d8 as their damage dice.

## Creating Monsters
Use the following template to model NPCs and monsters:
- Title (denotes the type of NPC/monster)
- NPC Name (most things have a name. Some have forgotten theirs and are now solely defined by their title)
-  X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X CTRL,
- Attack (dX, special items, qualities)
- Description (appearance or demeanor)
- Drive, behavior, tactic, or peculiarity
- Special effect or critical damage consequence.

#### General Principles
- Ability Scores are 10 unless noted.
- Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary.
- HP: 3 HP is average , 6 HP sturdy, 1 0+ HP is serious threat
- HP is Hit Protection, not a measure of Hit Points. It's a measure of skill, luck, drive, resilience.
- Flavor and style = memorable
- Use d6 as the baseline for damage.
- Including ways to deal stress makes the game more Weird (increases chance of Stress Fallout)
- Critical Damage triggers increase threat or strangeness

#### Creature Cheat Sheet:
- Able to avoid being hit? Give it **HP**.
- Soak up damage? Give it **Armor**.
- Physically powerful? Give it a high **STR** or larger damage dice.
- Quick? Give it high **DEX**.
- Weird? Give it high **CTRL** or ability to deal Stress Damage.

# Rules Summary

**ABILITIES**
**STR:** Physicality, brawn & toughness.
**DEX:** Speed, sneaking & precision.
**CTRL:**  Willpower, charm & weird.

**SAVES**
Roll d20 equal to or under target Ability.

**HIT PROTECTION**
**HP** reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage (both physical and stress).

**HEALING**
A quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

**DEPRIVATION**
**Deprived** keeps a PC from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to a PCs inventory. **Fatigue** takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times

**INVENTORY**
PCs have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.

**MAGIC**
<br> A new spell is created each morning. It is random or is a copy of one the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell. If deprived or in danger, a CTRL save may be required to avoid dire consequences.

**ACTIONS**
On their turn, characters may move 40ft and take a single action. Actions are casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable action. These take place simultaneously.

**Retreating** from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.

For the **Start of Combat** round, characters must pass an DEX save in order to act.
Subsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.

**COMBAT**
All attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their weapon die, subtract any Armor bonus, and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess damage is then dealt to STR.

If there are **Multiple attackers**, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. **Impaired** attacks (position of weakness) reduce damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. **Enhanced** attacks (position of advantage) increase damage die to 1d12. **Blast** affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**
Damage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death**; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 they are lost.

**STRESS & FALLOUT**
<br> Player chooses from the [Stress Fallout](#stress-fallout-tables) table when either:
- Stress reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0
- A PC takes critical stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)

<br> Each Stress Fallout entry:
- Can only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).
- Consumes an inventory slot.
