**MYSTERY FRAMEWORK**

***CREATING YOUR OWN MYSTERIES***
<br> This framework can use to create mysteries for Liminal Horror. The mystery [Plague of Frogs](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/plague-of-frogs) acts as an example of the mystery components.

|         |                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| TOUCHSTONES                | Create a list of films, games, comics, or novels to help anchor the tone and act as visual reference for the mystery.                           |
| CONCEPT                   | Write a clear and succinct concept statement. If it is too confusing, that may mean you need to edit some of the other variables in the mystery.|
| FACTIONS & THEIR GOALS     | List out the initial factions and their goals. Use the agendas to inform NPC reactions in and out of play.                 |
| DOOM Clock                   | Create a baseline sequence of events that will happen if the investigators donâ€™t intervene. Actions taken by the PCs change the progression of the DOOM clock. Changes to the DOOM clock should consider the goals of the factions at play. |
| HOOKS | Create multiple entry points that could be used to entangle the table in the mystery. |
| POTENTIAL CLUES  | Create a non-comprehensive list of potential clues that players can discover. When thinking about the mystery, think of tangible clues that the investigators can find. |
| NPCs | Create a list of important NPCs with their stat blocks. Use the [Paranatural Bestiary](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Paranatural%20Bestiary/) for some example monsters or create them using the [Creating Monsters](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Creating%20Monsters/) Guidance. |
| LOCATIONS | Decide on a few important locations and write some descriptions for them. Draft some rough maps of locations as a way to anchor investigators during play. |
