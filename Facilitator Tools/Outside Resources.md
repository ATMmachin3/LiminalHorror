## Outside Resources
Below are a collection of resources I have found that will help when planning sessions. They are a mix of blog posts, other horror games, and should be used to inspire and guide your planning.
- [The Trajectory of Fear - or How to Use Horror Tropes Effectively in your game](https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1453/84/1453840962349.pdf) (pdf) by Ash Law. This is a document that looks at how to use four types of fear (unease, dread, terror, horror) in your games.
- [20 Narrative Horror Resources](https://mordheim.es/20-narrative-horror-resources/) by Eduardo Caraba√±o. This is an evocative list of images and prompts to use/inspire.

<br> I have admired Throne of Salt's writing for quite a while. Here are is a (noncomprehensive) list of blog posts that one could use when planning sessions/mysteries/campaigns.
- [1d20 +1d6 Cults:](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2017/11/1d20-1d6-cults.html) Because what is a cosmic horror adventure without cults to fight against.
- [d50 Esoteric Enterprise Inspiration Seeds:](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2019/12/just-like-back-in-g-days.html) While written for a different game, many of these seeds could be dropped into a game of Liminal Horror. **Note:** Esoteric Enterprises is one of the games on the [Appendix N](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Appendix%20N/). Written by Dying Stylishly it is an OSR game of Urban Horror/Fantasy where you play outsiders exploring the dark underworld beneath our own. There are many thematic overlaps and some of the resources in Esoteric Enterprises could be implemented in Liminal Horror.
- [10 Esoteric Enterprises Hideouts:](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2019/10/10-esoteric-enterprises-hideouts.html) Who doesn't love a good hideout.
- [Ten Magical Items:](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2019/11/ten-magical-items.html) These could easily be hacked in to relics.
- [d20 Anomalous Media](http://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/11/d20-anomalous-media.html)
- [Organically-Grown Investigations](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/01/organically-grown-investigations.html) Some great advice on Investigation Games and how to run them.
