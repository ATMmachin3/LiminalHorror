# Localization
If you are interested in creating a version of Liminal Horror that is localized please reach out on twitter [@goblin_archvies](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives).

## Localization Guide
Yochai Gal (writer of Liminal Horror's parent system, Cairn) created a technical guide to creating localizations (with support of Stefano Grassi, who did the Italian Localization for Cairn). Yochai's guide is presented below with small edits to make it applicable to Liminal Horror.

Although the Liminal Horror rules exist in many forms ([PDF](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Px6ov7QiRNE3KBz1sgOO4CLOqV7eowX5_YIxNMa7ik/edit#heading=h.pi6t7cjtlmam), [Affinity Publisher File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKIryoyCWBKh9vfYgBf1I2RFuXUc-soy/view?usp=sharing), etc), the [SRD](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal-Horror-SRD/) is probably the best choice.

## Translating the SRD
1. Copy the [SRD Markdown](https://github.com/GoblinArchives/LiminalHorror/blob/gh-pages/Liminal-Horror-SRD.md) (click Raw) to a markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.com), [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) or a web-based renderer like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io). If you know how to use Git, you can use [Atom](atom.io). If you don't know markdown, don't worry! It's easy. Read more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

2. Do the hard work of translating the core document. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) and [deepl.com](https://deepl.com) are good resources; you can even simply translate the entire document once, then look through it for corrections.

## Forking the Github Repo
1. Create a [Github](https://github.com) account.

2. Go to [the repo](https://github.com/GoblinArchives/LiminalHorror) and click "Fork" in the upper right corner.

3. Name the repo LiminalHorror-**lang**, e.g. LiminalHorror-fr for French, etc. Your repo should be called something like https://github.com/yourusername/LiminalHorror-lang.

4. Copy the translated markdown into the cairn-srd.md file.

5. Translate the other pages in the repo (readme, resources, etc).

6.  Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to enable github pages on the new repo.

7. If you'd like to make changes to a local version of the website, follow this excellent guide by [David Schirduan](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2018/10/howto-markdown-blog).

## Building the PDF in Affinity Publisher
1. Download the trial of Affinity Publisher, and substitute the translation per word block.

2. Credit yourself and anyone who helped you!

3. Add "**Lang** Version" to the cover.
