The design work is top notch.
- [Agents of O.D.D. By Jason Toci - ttrpg](https://jasontocci.itch.io/agents-of-the-odd) If you are looking for a BPRD/Hellboy/Xfiles style game of cryptically and weird investigators of the paranormal you can’t find any better

- [The Thing - 1982 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)): One of the best films of all time. This would be a great scenario (if you had a mechanic for randomly replacing PCs/turning them into adversaries)
