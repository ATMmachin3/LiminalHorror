# Principles for Wardens
### Information
- Information should never be kept behind rolls.
- Provide information readily and freely to facilitate critical thinking and clever play.
- Elicit questions from players and give them direct answers.
- The weird and their mysteries should be layered, leading players ever downward into the unknown.


### Preparation
- Make the world alive, allow it to change and grow because of your playersâ€™ actions.
- Be flexible in your preparation. Create situations and possibilities. Plot and story should not be predefined.
- Give NPCs and factions motivations, flaws and drives. Have NPCs react accordingly to their principles, on and off screen. NPCs should always have a drive to survive.
- Play to find out what happens.


### Difficulty
- Realism and fictional positioning are a good starting place for setting difficulty.
- Choices should have consequences and all failure should be interesting.
- Saves cover various scenarios of uncertainty and risk. If there is neither, do not call for a roll.
- Reward cleverness and ingenuity.


### Danger
- The risk is great for lasting harm, fallout from stress and overwhelming danger of encountering the Old Powers or their progeny.
- Present the potential of danger clearly for players and give them the opportunity to react.
- Increasing the amount of stress will increase the rate investigators are enveloped by the corruption of the Old Powers.
- Characters die.


### Choice
- Offer tough choices.
- Seek to clarify a player's intent, establishing a clear choice between two outcomes. Sometimes both can be attempted for a price (risk, sacrifice, or a very clever idea).
- Every action should leave an impact on the world in some way.


### Failure
- Failure should always move the story forward. Often it is the most interesting outcome of all due to the introduction of novel complications.
- Foster a table where success and failure is exciting. It is encouraged to elicit complications or twists from players.


### Die of Fate
- Sometimes randomness is required. Roll 1d6 to consult the die of fate
- 6: Good result/ 4-5: Mixed result/ 1-3: Bad result
