# Principles for Wardens
### Information
- Information should never be kept behind rolls.
- Provide information readily and freely to facilitate critical thinking and clever play.
- Elicit questions from players and give them direct answers.
- The weird and their mysteries should be layered, leading players ever downward into the unknown.

### Secrets
- Fear of the unknown, dread, forbidden knowledge and existential threats on a grand  scale are essential themes in Cosmic Horror.
- While providing  information on the physical and tangible reality to players is key, make sure that the true nature of things remain hidden even as connections are made.
- Slowly give investigators opportunities to pull at threads, pushing them deeper into the weird.
- The scale of what the PCs face is incomprehensible. True understanding is unattainable.

### Preparation
- Make the world alive, allow it to change and grow because of your playersâ€™ actions.
- Be flexible in your preparation. Create situations and possibilities. Plot and story should not be predefined.
- Give NPCs and factions motivations, flaws and drives. Have NPCs react accordingly to their principles, on and off screen. NPCs should always have a drive to survive.
- Play to find out what happens.


### Difficulty
- Realism and fictional positioning are a good starting place for setting difficulty.
- Choices should have consequences and all failure should be interesting.
- Saves cover various scenarios of uncertainty and risk. If there is neither, do not call for a roll.
- Reward cleverness and ingenuity.


### Danger
- The risk is great for lasting harm, fallout from stress and overwhelming danger of encountering the Old Powers or their progeny.
- Present the potential of danger clearly for players and give them the opportunity to react.
- Increasing the amount of stress will increase the rate investigators are enveloped by the corruption of the Old Powers.
- Characters die.


### Choice
- Offer tough choices.
- All situations should have multiple outcomes.
- Clarify player intent before dice are rolled to make sure players have all information that would be obvious to their character.
- Not every outcome can be fully known to a player before rolling, especially if it involves the Weird. A key aspect of the Old Powers is that their influence bends and breaks reality.
- Every action should leave an impact on the world in some way.



### Failure
- Failure should always move the story forward. Often it is the most interesting outcome of all due to the introduction of novel complications.
- Foster a table where success and failure is exciting. It is encouraged to elicit complications or twists from players.


### Die of Fate
- Sometimes randomness is required. Roll 1d6 to consult the die of fate
- 6: Good result/ 4-5: Mixed result/ 1-3: Bad result
