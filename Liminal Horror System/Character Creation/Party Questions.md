# Party Questions

#### The Party
Why has the party come together? Use the answers from the Get To Know Your Character section to inform your decision. Some examples are:
- The investigators meet in a diner. They may or may not know each other. Fluorescent lights hum over checkered linoleum.
- A simple “wrong place, wrong time.” The resulting event binds the investigators together.
- United through self guided research. Online paranatural forum? Club? Support group?
- A mysterious patron that has brought the investigators together.
- Members of the community respond to a series of mysterious events.
- Investigators (either professional or amateur) that are looking into an event.

#### Character Bonds (optional)
Have each player state a relationship to another character at the table. This should be informed by the background, The Abyss Stares Back, and The Party section of character creation.

#### Vehicles
Determine as a group what types of vehicle or transportation the party has access to. The party may have access to more than one vehicle. Car chases are an essential part of solving a mystery.
Vehicles have HP. When it is reduced to 0HP it is totaled. Totaling a vehicle can cause damage to those in and around the vehicle.
